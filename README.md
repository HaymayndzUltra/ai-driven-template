Read the six docs (WHAT, WHY, HOW-1..4). Choose the best HOW option and decide on a/b/c/d for integration depth, automation coverage, and human validation gates using explicit evidence from the docs. Then output: Recommendation, Rationale (Evidence-based), CD-MIE Framework (Concise with 8 phases and gates), Automation binding map, Minimal phase templates, Acceptance Criteria, Activation Plan, Risks & Mitigations, Next Actions. Prefer deep integration with existing workflow, targeted new scripts, and comprehensive human gates if supported by the texts. If anythingâ€™s missing, ask briefly and provide a provisional answer with assumptions.
