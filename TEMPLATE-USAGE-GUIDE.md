## Detailed Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Project Brief Creation

Create a `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` file with your project description. Include:

**Required Sections**:
- **Project Overview**: What you're building
- **Target Audience**: Who will use it
- **Technology Stack**: What technologies to use
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, technical limitations
- **Success Criteria**: How you'll measure success

**Example PROJECT-BRIEF.md**:
```markdown
# PROJECT-BRIEF.md

## Project Overview
Create a multi-tenant SaaS application for project management with real-time collaboration features.

## Target Audience
Small to medium businesses (10-500 employees) managing multiple projects.

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Real-time: WebSocket connections
- Deployment: AWS with Docker

## Requirements
### Functional
- User authentication and authorization
- Project creation and management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Real-time notifications
- Team collaboration features

### Non-Functional
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- GDPR compliance
- Mobile-responsive design

## Constraints
- Budget: $50K development cost
- Timeline: 6 months to MVP
- Team: 3 developers + 1 designer

## Success Criteria
- 100+ active users within 3 months
- <2 second page load times
- 90%+ user satisfaction score
```

### Step 2: Protocol Orchestration

Invoke the protocol orchestrator to analyze your brief and generate appropriate protocols:

```bash
# In Cursor IDE
@protocol-orchestrator.md
```

**What Happens**:
1. AI reads your PROJECT-BRIEF.md
2. AI analyzes project type, complexity, and requirements
3. AI selects appropriate protocols from the library
4. AI generates custom protocols for specific needs
5. AI creates numbered command files in `.cursor/commands/`
6. AI presents the generated sequence for your approval

**Expected Output**:
```
[ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE] Generated 8 protocols for your SaaS project:
- 00-analyze-brief.md âœ… (validate requirements)
- 01-bootstrap-architecture.md âœ… (analyze patterns)
- 02-security-design.md âœ… (multi-tenancy, compliance)
- 03-database-schema.md âœ… (complex data model)
- 04-api-contracts.md âœ… (OpenAPI specification)
- 05-implementation-tasks.md âœ… (development plan)
- 06-security-validation.md âœ… (compliance testing)
- 07-deployment-checklist.md âœ… (production readiness)
- 08-retrospective.md âœ… (capture learnings)

SKIPPED: monitoring (covered in deployment), docs (self-explanatory)

ðŸ‘¤ USER ACTION REQUIRED: Type "approve" to proceed or "modify" to adjust
```

### Step 3: Protocol Execution

Execute the generated protocols sequentially:

```bash
# Execute each protocol in order
cursor apply .cursor/commands/00-analyze-brief.md
# Complete the task, then proceed to next
cursor apply .cursor/commands/01-bootstrap-architecture.md
# Continue with remaining protocols...
```

**What Happens During Execution**:
1. AI loads the protocol instructions
2. AI applies relevant rules and context
3. AI executes protocol steps automatically
4. AI runs validation scripts
5. AI collects evidence artifacts
6. AI reports completion status

**Manual Steps Required**:
- Stakeholder approvals (for PRD sign-off)
- External service configuration (API keys, credentials)
- Production deployment approval
- Code review and PR merges

### Step 4: Quality Gates and Validation

The system automatically enforces quality gates:

**Automated Validation**:
- Test suite execution
- Code coverage analysis
- Security scanning
- Performance benchmarking
- Linting and formatting

**Manual Approvals Required**:
- Quality audit report review
- Deployment to production approval
- Acceptance criteria confirmation
- Protocol completion sign-off

### Step 5: Evidence Collection and Retrospective

The system automatically collects evidence throughout the process:

**Evidence Artifacts**:
- Protocol execution logs
- Test results and coverage reports
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks
- Architecture decision records
- User feedback and approvals

**Retrospective Generation**:
- AI analyzes all evidence
- AI identifies learnings and improvements
- AI generates retrospective report
- AI suggests system improvements
