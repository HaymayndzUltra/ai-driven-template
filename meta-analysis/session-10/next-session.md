## Continuity Guidance
- Trace how the integration guide’s automation recommendations flow into the dedicated protocol integration methodology to verify phased alignment and evidence pipelines remain synchronized.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L45-L159】
- Ensure orchestration mandates from the upcoming protocol orchestrator extend the regression-zero safety posture established by the code modification kernel, especially around escalation gates and rollback messaging.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L256-L300】【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol.mdc†L91-L205】
- When reviewing advanced meta-instruction intelligence, confirm its persona and discovery routines respect the rule creation governance pillars so any adaptive behaviors still emit compliant `[STRICT]`/`[GUIDELINE]` directives.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L19-L129】
- Prepare to map UI foundation common rules back to documentation integrity expectations so component standards propagate into READMEs and integration artifacts without divergence.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc†L38-L80】

## Evidence Requirements
- Document cross-references between integration methodology phases and the six recommendations already analyzed, highlighting automation or evidence checkpoints that persist.
- Capture how orchestration directives inherit safety and reporting constructs, noting any explicit rollback or validation language.
- Record how adaptive intelligence frameworks align with rule metadata, personas, and directive prefixes to maintain discoverability.
- Gather citations tying UI foundation requirements to documentation or integration artifacts to prove context fidelity is preserved.

## Session Goals
- Deliver five-section analyses for the next three master rules plus the first UI common rule to transition from kernel governance into applied design standards.
- Extend insights to show continuity between automation orchestration, safety governance, and adaptive rule authoring.
- Update AGENTS.md tracker upon completion to reflect the expanded master and common rule coverage.
