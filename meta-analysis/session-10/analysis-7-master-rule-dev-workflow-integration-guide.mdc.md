# Meta-Instruction Analysis: 7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Adopt integration architect persona orchestrating five-protocol lifecycle coupling.
- Reasoning: The rule defines meta-intent, persona, and behavioral directives that enforce sequential adherence to the ai-driven-workflow phases.
- Meta-heuristic: Treat workflow integration as mission-critical architecture requiring disciplined phase progression and validated checkpoints.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L6-L25】

**Step 2:** Enumerate lifecycle overview linking protocols with supporting systems.
- Reasoning: Integration architecture overview lists six protocols, template packs, project generator, automation scripts, and CI/CD workflows.
- Meta-heuristic: Holistic mapping ensures every lifecycle stage is coupled with tooling ecosystems to avoid manual gaps.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L27-L42】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Issue six strict integration recommendations with problems, solutions, and success criteria.
- Reasoning: Each recommendation outlines context, implementation references, key actions, and measurable outcomes from rule automation through evidence pipelines.
- Meta-heuristic: Prescriptive interventions align conversational protocols with automation assets, guaranteeing deterministic integration coverage.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L45-L144】

**Step 2:** Define sequential checkpoints governing transitions between workflow phases.
- Reasoning: Checkpoints 1-6 specify validations, handoff artifacts, and gates from bootstrap to next tasks, preventing premature progression.
- Meta-heuristic: Stage-gated governance ensures each phase produces artifacts and approvals before handing off to the next.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L162-L253】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Standardize communication tags and progress reporting formats.
- Reasoning: Integration status announcements and reporting templates require standardized prefixes and structured updates.
- Meta-heuristic: Controlled messaging provides consistent telemetry for integration progress and automation actions.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L256-L278】

**Step 2:** Codify validation, rollback, testing, and success criteria sequences.
- Reasoning: Validation protocol, rollback steps, examples, testing harness, and success checklist define concrete procedures and expected evidence.
- Meta-heuristic: Procedural codification guarantees integration efforts are verifiable, recoverable, and benchmarked against objective metrics.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L281-L452】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Provide exemplars contrasting correct versus anti-pattern narratives across phases.
- Reasoning: Example sections show compliant integration messaging and highlight failures when automation and evidence are omitted.
- Meta-heuristic: Narrative contrasts educate operators on acceptable communication and reporting behaviors for integration tasks.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L302-L389】

**Step 2:** Define precedence, conflict resolution, and reference catalog.
- Reasoning: Precedence rules, conflict protocol, version history, and references articulate how to resolve clashes and where to source detailed implementations.
- Meta-heuristic: Governance clarity ensures integration guidance overrides ad-hoc decisions while pointing agents to authoritative resources.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc†L465-L504】
