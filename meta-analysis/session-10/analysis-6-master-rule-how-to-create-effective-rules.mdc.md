# Meta-Instruction Analysis: 6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Embody framework architect persona governing rule governance.
- Reasoning: The rule defines an architect identity focused on creating and maintaining the rule system, emphasizing discoverability and maintainability stakes.
- Meta-heuristic: Treat rule creation as infrastructure design where governance quality determines downstream AI performance.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L5-L14】

**Step 2:** Establish core dependence on four structural pillars.
- Reasoning: The rule states that every new rule must implement structure & discoverability, personality & intent, precision & clarity, and exemplarity & contrast pillars.
- Meta-heuristic: Multi-pillar doctrine ensures each rule is simultaneously findable, directive, and demonstrated through examples.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L15-L83】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Impose classification, naming, and metadata verification before authoring.
- Reasoning: Pillar 1 describes rule existence checks, directory mapping, naming conventions, and YAML frontmatter requirements with strict constraints.
- Meta-heuristic: Pre-creation governance prevents duplication and enforces consistent metadata that drives rule discovery signals.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L19-L57】

**Step 2:** Mandate persona declaration and core principle articulation.
- Reasoning: Pillar 2 instructs authors to assign personas and state core principles, specifying example phrasing.
- Meta-heuristic: Behavioral framing primes agents to think with correct intent and context when rules activate.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L58-L66】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Enforce directive language and prefix discipline for all protocols.
- Reasoning: Pillar 3 requires imperative statements with `[STRICT]` or `[GUIDELINE]` prefixes, ensuring clarity and enforceability.
- Meta-heuristic: Binary directive taxonomy eliminates ambiguity, allowing agents to differentiate mandatory steps from best practices.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L67-L76】

**Step 2:** Require contrasting examples and final review checklist.
- Reasoning: Pillar 4 compels "DO" and "DON'T" sections, while the final checklist validates structure, metadata, persona, precision, and exemplarity before publishing.
- Meta-heuristic: Example-driven validation plus a closure checklist institutionalizes quality assurance for each new rule artifact.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L77-L129】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Direct full-content proposals for creation and modification workflows.
- Reasoning: Implementation notes instruct assistants to propose complete file contents to safeguard YAML metadata integrity and provide messaging guidance.
- Meta-heuristic: Whole-file diffs prevent metadata corruption and set expectations for collaborator communication during rule updates.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L132-L157】

**Step 2:** Outline automation-friendly alternatives with explicit command recipes.
- Reasoning: The rule offers CLI-based approaches and search procedures for discovery, emphasizing reliable metadata handling.
- Meta-heuristic: Operational transparency empowers scripted workflows while maintaining strict metadata discipline.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc†L134-L159】
