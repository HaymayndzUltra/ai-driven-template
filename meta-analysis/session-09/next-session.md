## Priority Files
1. .cursor/rules/master-rules/4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol.mdc
2. .cursor/rules/master-rules/5-master-rule-documentation-and-context-guidelines.mdc
3. .cursor/rules/master-rules/6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc
4. .cursor/rules/master-rules/7-master-rule-dev-workflow-integration-guide.mdc

## Continuity Guidance
- Trace how the safety protocol reinforces the kernel-preserving strategy established by the rule injection system to ensure enhanced reviews cannot bypass mandatory guards.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/utils/rule-injection-system.md†L93-L321】
- Map dependencies from the context discovery BIOS into documentation mandates to confirm README sourcing and announcement rituals stay synchronized across governance layers.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/1-master-rule-context-discovery.mdc†L62-L135】【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines.mdc†L63-L172】
- Evaluate how new rule creation guidelines align with the code quality baseline so freshly crafted rules uphold defensive clarity standards.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/3-master-rule-code-quality-checklist.mdc†L5-L35】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture citations that link safety escalation steps to previously analyzed context-announcement checkpoints.
- Document any cross-references between documentation protocols and collaboration context preservation triggers.
- Record heuristics for authoring or integrating rules that maintain kernel compatibility with the registry and analyzer ecosystem.

## Session Goals
- Deliver five-section analyses for the next four master rules to progress through the remaining kernel corpus.
- Extend insights with mappings between safety enforcement, documentation governance, and rule authoring frameworks.
- Update AGENTS.md tracker after completing the targeted master rules.
