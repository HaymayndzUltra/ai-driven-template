## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Key Architectural Discoveries**:
  - # Meta-Instruction Analysis: .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md
    **Architectural Dependencies:**
    - Subsystem A primes both branching logic and layer-specific interrogation by ensuring architectural awareness; without it, subsequent questioning would lack context fidelity.
    - Subsystem B's confirmed layer selection dictates which question set in Subsystem C activates, demonstrating dependency-driven flow control.
    - Constraint validation in Subsystem D must follow specification capture to cross-check gathered requirements against communication policies, enabling safe synthesis in Subsystem E.
    - Automation pipeline (Subsystem F) hinges on confirmation from Subsystem E; validation scripts rely on finalized architecture summaries to compute completeness scores.
    - The PRD template (Subsystem G) depends on outputs from Subsystems C-F to populate sections, acting as downstream packaging.
    
    **Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
    - Context-first reasoning ensures interrogation quality by mandating architectural immersion before dialogue.
    - Adaptive interview trees reduce cognitive drift by aligning questions with feature novelty.
    - Compliance gating embeds deterministic validation, preventing premature transitions to downstream protocols.
    - Telemetry announcements cultivate auditability, making automation results transparent.
    
    **Cognitive Role Modularity:**
    - Planner: Subsystems A-C orchestrate discovery and requirement structuring.
    - Executor: Subsystem F executes automation scripts to materialize artifacts.
    - Validator: Subsystem D enforces communication constraints, while F3 handles validation scoring.
    - Auditor: Subsystem E’s confirmation dialogue and automation announcements maintain traceable checkpoints.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS

### analysis-1-create-prd.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Establish PRD ownership and scope boundaries.
- Reasoning: Lines 3-14 assign the agent as Product Manager and forbid implementation, forcing the system to constrain action space to specification work only.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L3-L14】
- Meta-heuristic: Role isolation to prevent scope creep into downstream protocols.

**Step 2:** Anchor decision-making on architecture awareness and decision matrix.
- Reasoning: The prerequisite and matrix directives (lines 9-27) require architectural familiarization before interviews, ensuring context-first reasoning.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L9-L27】
- Meta-heuristic: Context priming prior to interrogation to avoid misaligned questioning.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 3:** Branch interrogation based on feature novelty.
- Reasoning: Section 1.1 demands classification between new vs existing features, driving the agent to follow different questioning paths.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L32-L59】
- Meta-heuristic: Conditional interview routing for adaptive discovery.

**Step 4:** Require explicit layer detection and validation.
- Reasoning: Lines 60-75 force the agent to announce an implementation layer and confirm with the user, making behavioral flow dependent on validated architectural placement.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L60-L75】
- Meta-heuristic: Shared mental model confirmation loop.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 5:** Execute layer-specific specification interrogation.
- Reasoning: Phase 2 enumerates targeted questions per detected layer, guiding structured data collection for PRD sections.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L77-L97】
- Meta-heuristic: Template-driven elicitation for comprehensive requirement capture.

**Step 6:** Enforce communication constraint validation before synthesis.
- Reasoning: Phase 3 checks allowed vs prohibited flows to prevent architectural violations, acting as procedural guardrails.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L100-L111】
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic compliance gating.

**Step 7:** Synthesize architecture and validate readiness prior to automation.
- Reasoning: Phase 4 requires summarizing architecture and requesting confirmation, ensuring procedural closure before automation triggers.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L114-L126】
- Meta-heuristic: Confirmation-before-commitment.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 8:** Automate artifact generation with mandated announcements.
- Reasoning: Phase 4.5 prescribes exact commands and broadcast formats for PRD assets and validation outcomes, encoding communication grammar for automation states.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L127-L155】
- Meta-heuristic: Structured telemetry for human-auditable automation.

**Step 9:** Provide final PRD template for downstream rendering.
- Reasoning: Lines 164-187 give a markdown template, standardizing deliverable communication and ensuring consistent output grammar.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L164-L187】
- Meta-heuristic: Canonical documentation framing to maintain interoperability.
