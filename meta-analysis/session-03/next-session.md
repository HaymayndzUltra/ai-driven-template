# Next Session Plan

## Priority Files
1. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md
2. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md

## Continuity Guidance
- Maintain the context-first interrogation pattern established in Protocol 1 so downstream task generation inherits validated architecture layers.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L60-L126】
- Track how automation gates evolve after PRD completion to map dependencies into execution protocols.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L127-L160】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture explicit references for branching logic and validation gates in each analyzed protocol.
- Update AGENTS.md progress checklist after completing the selected files.

## Session Goals
- Produce full 5-section analyses for both files with ASCII diagrams.
- Extend dependency mapping between discovery, execution, and validation phases.
