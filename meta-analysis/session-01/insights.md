# Session 01 Insights

- Governance-first bootstrapping ensures Cursor rule normalization precedes any analysis, preventing compliance drift later in the workflow (ref. 0-bootstrap-your-project.md L13-L22, L128-L137).
- Human validation checkpoints punctuate mapping and synthesis, anchoring collaborative certainty before documentation or automation proceeds (ref. 0-bootstrap-your-project.md L35-L40, L94-L108).
- The protocol fuses semantic investigation with artifact codification, requiring principles to flow into README generation, rule audits, and context kit updates for enduring institutional memory (ref. 0-bootstrap-your-project.md L61-L187).
