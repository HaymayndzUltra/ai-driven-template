# SESSION 2 INSTRUCTIONS

## Resume Point
- Previous session: SESSION 1 (completed 1 file)
- Total progress: 1 file analyzed
- Remaining: 32 files

## Priority Targets
1. Continue scanning `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/` and `.cursor/rules/` to identify the next highest-impact protocol or rule files.
2. Favor documents that extend governance scaffolding established in Protocol 0 (e.g., `1-create-prd.md` or master rules explaining context discovery).

## Required Outputs
- For each selected file, produce a full 5-section analysis (Phase Map, Meta-Architecture Diagram, Commentary, Inference Summary, Output Instructions) with line references.
- Update `files-analyzed.txt`, `insights.md`, and regenerate `next-session.md` reflecting new totals.
- Append newly deduced meta-framework linkages to `insights.md` to preserve the context chain.

## Context Reminders
- Maintain the governance-first narrative: every new protocol should be mapped back to how it consumes artifacts from Protocol 0 (context kit, rule normalization).
- Track dependencies between planning, execution, and audit phases so the meta-architecture can be unified later.

## Evidence Expectations
- Use `nl -ba` to capture line numbers for every cited instruction.
- Document any ambiguities or blockers directly in the session commentary files for future resolution.

## Quality Gates
- Verify ASCII diagrams render correctly in Markdown preview.
- Confirm that human validation checkpoints identified in new files align with previously mapped checkpoints.
