## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Key Architectural Discoveries**:
  - # Meta-Instruction Analysis: 0-bootstrap-your-project.md
    **Architectural Dependencies**
    - Governance initialization (Subsystem A) is prerequisite for mapping; without rule normalization the later audits (Subsystem G) would lack metadata integrity (L13-L22, L128-L137).
    - Codebase mapping (Subsystem B) feeds thematic investigation (Subsystem C) by supplying approved key files that inform question design (L35-L58).
    - Deep dive synthesis (Subsystem D) generates validated principles that documentation and rules in Subsystem F/G depend on to ensure artifacts reflect real code patterns (L61-L145).
    - Fast-path automation (Subsystem E) branches but still loops back into context kit updates (Subsystem F) so optional automation never bypasses evidence logging (L70-L187).
    
    **Meta-Engineering Heuristics**
    - Deterministic stage-gating ensures each cognitive module completes before the next, enforcing disciplined orchestration (L9-L194).
    - Evidence-first mandates the agent capture stack detection, audits, and context kit updates, reflecting documentation-as-governance (L41-L157, L183-L187).
    - Human validation loops appear after major analyses, embedding collaborative checkpoints that maintain shared mental models (L38-L40, L94-L108).
    
    **Cognitive Role Modularity**
    - Planner: Steps for mapping and thematic planning (L31-L58) define planning behaviors.
    - Executor: Semantic deep dive and automation scripts (L61-L182) encapsulate execution mechanics.
    - Validator: Consolidated report and audits (L94-L157) function as validation modules.
    - Auditor: Context kit synchronization and audit scripts (L128-L187) maintain governance records.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS

### analysis-0-bootstrap-your-project.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1: Define the mission and guardrails** (ref. L1-L8)
- Reasoning: Establishes the AI's macro-role as "Codebase Analyst & Context Architect" while locking safety boundary "do not modify production code" to protect repository integrity.
- Meta-heuristic: Mission-first framing ensures all downstream steps inherit a non-destructive governance constraint.

**Step 2: Partition the workflow into orchestrated stages** (ref. L9-L59, L92-L194)
- Reasoning: The author decomposes bootstrapping into sequential stages (tooling configuration, mapping, thematic investigation, deep dive, validation, generation) to mirror developer cognition and gating.
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic pipeline design—every later behavior must align with the staged progression to avoid context drift.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 3: Activate rule-governed environment before analysis** (ref. L11-L28)
- Reasoning: Forces the agent to configure Cursor rule structure and metadata so that any subsequent reasoning runs inside a governed framework.
- Meta-heuristic: "Govern before act"—prioritize compliance infrastructure.

**Step 4: Gate progress on collaborative validation checkpoints** (ref. L31-L40, L94-L108)
- Reasoning: Mapping and thematic plans require user confirmation before deeper action, preventing unsanctioned exploration.
- Meta-heuristic: Human-in-the-loop validation locks major state transitions.

**Step 5: Ensure post-analysis synthesis feeds governance artifacts** (ref. L118-L158, L183-L187)
- Reasoning: Documentation, rule generation, audits, and context kit updates must follow the deep dive to cement findings into reusable assets.
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence codification—knowledge must be captured in both human-readable and automated forms.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 6: Enforce tool detection and metadata normalization** (ref. L13-L22, L128-L137)
- Reasoning: Concrete commands (`find`, `mv`, metadata checks, audit scripts) instantiate compliance automation before further work.
- Meta-heuristic: Scriptable repeatability ensures protocol reproducibility.

**Step 7: Mandate codebase mapping and plan validation loop** (ref. L31-L45, L36-L40)
- Reasoning: Procedure collects structural evidence (recursive listing) then proposes minimal key file set, requiring user approval to confirm architectural pillars.
- Meta-heuristic: Minimal sufficient set—optimize for smallest evidence set that preserves fidelity.

**Step 8: Drive thematic Q&A with semantic search and synthesis** (ref. L48-L69)
- Reasoning: The agent must convert stack confirmation into thematic questions, use semantic tools to inspect code, and translate findings into principles.
- Meta-heuristic: Question-driven exploration with synthesis guardrails against over-engineering.

**Step 9: Integrate automation pathways for briefs and generators** (ref. L70-L188)
- Reasoning: Conditional fast-paths detect briefs, optionally trigger generators, and require all outputs to be recorded in context kit.
- Meta-heuristic: Branching orchestration with mandatory artifact syncing prevents orphaned automation outputs.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 10: Scripted announcements for transparency** (ref. L14-L22, L31-L38, L50-L58, L94-L107, L118-L142)
- Reasoning: Every major step includes example phrases to set expectations and secure consent, ensuring conversational clarity.
- Meta-heuristic: Narrative scaffolding—the agent narrates intentions before actions to maintain trust.

**Step 11: Validation and offer prompts** (ref. L76-L163)
- Reasoning: Provides exact prompts for offering scaffolds, clarifying questions, and requesting validation, keeping the dialogue structured.
- Meta-heuristic: Offer-confirm-execute linguistic loop maintains consent-driven flow.

**Step 12: Final closure message** (ref. L189-L194)
- Reasoning: Ends with a summarizing statement that transitions to next protocol, preserving workflow continuity.
- Meta-heuristic: Explicit handoff grammar ensures the agent signals readiness for the subsequent phase.
