## Continuity Guidance
- Validate how the rule injection system feeds critical vs context-triggered rule tiers into enhanced templates so the router’s cascades and analyzer prioritization remain synchronized.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/utils/_review-router.md†L24-L144】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/utils/enhanced-static-template.md†L40-L61】
- When entering master rules, trace references from the analyzer’s relevance mapping to confirm terminology and priority levels match the authoritative rule corpus.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/utils/context-analyzer.md†L52-L90】
- Preserve the validation mindset by checking each master rule for explicit evidence hooks or KPI expectations that align with the enhanced validation gates documented this session.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/utils/enhanced-static-validation.md†L269-L328】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture citations that show how rule injection transforms analyzer outputs into executable checklists, noting any required data contracts.
- Record master rule sections that define severity vocabularies, escalation triggers, or audit artifacts needed by the router and validation framework.
- Document dependencies between master rules and review utilities, highlighting any terminology that must remain consistent for telemetry ingestion.

## Session Goals
- Produce five-section analyses for the rule injection utility and at least three master rule files to initiate the corpus synthesis.
- Update the insight log with mappings between analyzer priorities, router modes, and master rule clauses.
- Advance the AGENTS.md tracker by checking off the completed utility and newly analyzed master rules.
