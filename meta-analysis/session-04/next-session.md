# Next Session Plan

## Priority Files
1. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md
2. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md

## Continuity Guidance
- Trace how the automation hooks and validation artifacts mandated in Protocol 2 feed directly into Protocol 4’s quality gates to preserve telemetry continuity.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L71-L127】
- Maintain alignment with the session-isolated execution capsules defined in Protocol 3 so the retrospective analysis inherits audited evidence without context bleed.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L16-L199】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture explicit references for quality scoring criteria, automation verification steps, and retrospective documentation mandates in each protocol.
- Update AGENTS.md progress checklist after completing the selected files.

## Session Goals
- Deliver full five-section analyses with ASCII diagrams for both protocols.
- Extend dependency mapping from task execution into auditing and learning loops, emphasizing artifact reuse and communication grammar.
