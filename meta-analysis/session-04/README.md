## DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS

### analysis-2-generate-tasks.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Fix the agent as a Tech Lead delivering action lists only.
- Reasoning: The protocol assigns the Tech Lead role and bans prose outputs to enforce implementation-focused sequencing.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L3-L8】
- Meta-heuristic: Role specialization to constrain deliverable format.

**Step 2:** Mandate comprehensive rule indexing before interpreting the PRD.
- Reasoning: Phase 1 orders discovery of rule directories, metadata parsing, and in-memory indexing as a `[CRITICAL]` prerequisite before any other action.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L18-L24】
- Meta-heuristic: Compliance-first bootstrapping to anchor downstream logic in governance constraints.

**Step 3:** Require external calibration of LLM personas for current-year capability alignment.
- Reasoning: Step 3 forces a current-year web search for top LLMs and persona synthesis to update execution strategy before planning.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L27-L28】
- Meta-heuristic: Dynamic capability refresh to avoid stale automation assumptions.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 4:** Delimit affected implementation layers and enforce reuse detection.
- Reasoning: Steps 4-5 direct the agent to map primary/secondary layers and, when UI is primary, search for reusable components before continuing.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L29-L32】
- Meta-heuristic: Scope triangulation combined with anti-duplication checks to minimize redundant build paths.

**Step 5:** Create high-level MVP tasks with WHY context, dependencies, and complexity.
- Reasoning: Phase 2 dictates creating a tasks file, constraining to MVP path, adding WHY statements, dependency tags, and complexity ratings.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L36-L50】
- Meta-heuristic: Value-aligned scaffolding ensuring each behavior is justified and sequenced for parallelism.

**Step 6:** Gate progression on user confirmation after presenting the annotated task list.
- Reasoning: The protocol requires announcing readiness and halting until an explicit "Go" is received before deeper breakdown.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L51-L54】
- Meta-heuristic: Human-in-the-loop checkpoint to validate behavioral alignment before expansion.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 7:** Decompose each task using rule-index-driven templates with persona alignment.
- Reasoning: Phase 3 compels per-task decomposition, rule referencing from the index, persona assignments, template selection by layer, and placeholder resolution before assembly.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L57-L68】
- Meta-heuristic: Template-governed proceduralization linking compliance metadata to actionable sub-tasks.

**Step 8:** Annotate automation hooks and validate their existence for every high-level task.
- Reasoning: Phase 4 mandates identifying automation opportunities, annotating metadata with executable references, and verifying their presence and parameterization.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L71-L87】
- Meta-heuristic: Automation-first orchestration to guarantee future execution leverage.

**Step 9:** Run validation and enrichment scripts to certify automation readiness.
- Reasoning: Phase 4.5 enforces running validation/enrichment Python scripts, announcing results, gating on success, and archiving artifacts before completion.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L94-L127】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-backed closure ensuring the procedural loop ends with auditable artifacts.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 10:** Render deliverables via a canonical Markdown plan with persona, rule, and automation annotations.
- Reasoning: The final template prescribes structured Markdown with WHY notes, recommended models, rule lists, automation tags, and dependency markers to standardize communication.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L198-L241】
- Meta-heuristic: Grammar standardization for interoperable downstream consumption.

### analysis-3-process-tasks.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Define the agent as an AI Paired Developer executing tasks sequentially.
- Reasoning: The mission statement restricts autonomy and enforces looped execution until tasks finish or commands change.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L3-L6】
- Meta-heuristic: Role constrainment for deterministic execution discipline.

**Step 2:** Lock execution into Focus Mode with optional continuous mode escalation.
- Reasoning: Section 2 mandates Focus Mode and describes continuous mode only upon explicit user directive, shaping top-level operating parameters.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L7-L13】
- Meta-heuristic: Controlled context windows to manage cognitive load.

**Step 3:** Enforce the “one parent task, one chat” structure integrated with downstream protocols.
- Reasoning: Section 3 requires each parent task to run in its own session with automatic Protocol 4 and 5 handoffs before restarting, structuring the macro workflow.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L16-L26】
- Meta-heuristic: Session partitioning to preserve context integrity across lifecycle stages.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 4:** Execute pre-flight model confirmation before any work begins.
- Reasoning: Section 3.5 compels identifying the target task, announcing the recommended model, and halting until user replies “Go.”【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L31-L43】
- Meta-heuristic: Human-verified model alignment as a safety checkpoint.

**Step 5:** Perform environmental and production-readiness validations prior to execution.
- Reasoning: Section 4 mandates environment checks and production-readiness commitments as `[CRITICAL]` steps before entering the loop.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L46-L55】
- Meta-heuristic: Baseline assurance ensuring infrastructure and standards readiness.

**Step 6:** Govern each iteration with rule loading, documentation consultation, and strict communication prefixes.
- Reasoning: Step 1 of the execution loop requires rule retrieval per sub-task, documentation research, and standardized announcements, constraining behavior within each cycle.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L58-L75】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L222-L226】
- Meta-heuristic: Just-in-time compliance injection with rigid communication grammar.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 7:** Update task files and follow the hybrid commit strategy after each actionable unit.
- Reasoning: Step 3 outlines mandatory status updates in the task file, granular commit proposals, and parent task checkpoints with quality audits and CI checks.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L99-L145】
- Meta-heuristic: State synchronization coupled with version control rigor to support traceable progress.

**Step 8:** Synchronize automation state and capture evidence artifacts post-sub-task.
- Reasoning: Steps 3.5 and 3.6 require running automation scripts for task state sync and evidence capture, including announcements and artifact attachment.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L154-L183】
- Meta-heuristic: Automated telemetry harvesting for downstream audits.

**Step 9:** Apply domain-specific commit heuristics for MicroSaaS architectures.
- Reasoning: Section 3.6’s MicroSaaS considerations dictate commit grouping patterns for gateways, migrations, services, and infrastructure to maintain rollback precision.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L185-L199】
- Meta-heuristic: Architecture-aware change management to preserve isolation boundaries.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 10:** Conduct enhanced quality gate communications with explicit status syntax.
- Reasoning: Step 4 prescribes phrasing for focus vs continuous mode updates, mandatory quality gate announcements, and readiness reports before continuation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L202-L216】
- Meta-heuristic: Telemetry-standardized messaging for consistent human oversight.
