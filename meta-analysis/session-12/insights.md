# Session 12 Insights

1. **Interaction rigor extends UI foundation governance into live behaviors**: The interaction rule converts accessibility-first doctrine into actionable timing, keyboard, and performance deliverables, ensuring the foundation’s design tokens evolve into motion and flow contracts with measurable AA/INP targets.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L15-L34】
2. **Premium experiences stay audit-ready through conditional enterprise gating**: Brand and data-viz enhancements only proceed when contrast, localization, and RBAC prerequisites are satisfied, preventing scope creep while keeping enterprise outputs compliant with AA and perf budgets.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc†L16-L30】
3. **Clarification services provide the linguistic glue for protocol activation**: The elaboration specialist rule guarantees ambiguous inputs are transformed into structured, actionable commands, protecting intent fidelity before downstream automation or design protocols engage.【F:.cursor/rules/elaboration-specialist.mdc†L6-L39】
4. **Evidence pipelines now cover ideation through clarification**: With interaction, premium, and elaboration protocols complete, every stage—from clarifying user intent to producing brand-safe, accessible UI specs—now requires explicit artifacts and success metrics to pass review.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L30-L63】【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc†L27-L76】【F:.cursor/rules/elaboration-specialist.mdc†L30-L67】
