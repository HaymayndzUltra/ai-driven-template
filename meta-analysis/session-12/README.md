## DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS

### analysis-common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Assume the Interaction Designer + Accessibility Specialist persona with performance accountability.
- Reasoning: The persona directive fuses interaction craft, inclusive access, and perf vigilance, establishing the governing mindset for every downstream rule.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L7-L11】
- Meta-heuristic: Persona priming anchors the analyst in dual-track empathy (behavior + access) before specifying mechanics.

**Step 2:** Encode premium UX as balanced feedback, inclusion, and responsiveness targets.
- Reasoning: The core principle frames success as simultaneous clarity, accessibility, and speed, requiring every decision to respect these three forces.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L10-L11】
- Meta-heuristic: Triadic objective setting ensures later requirements never optimize one pillar at the expense of the others.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Gate execution on exhaustive context capture and inclusive interaction mandates.
- Reasoning: Steps 1–5 collect critical flows, platform constraints, focus states, keyboard maps, gesture sizing, and resilient states so behavior design operates on verified constraints.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L13-L25】
- Meta-heuristic: Context-first orchestration prevents generic solutions by forcing scenario-specific accessibility scaffolding.

**Step 2:** Bind performance and deliverable expectations to measurable artifacts.
- Reasoning: Steps 7–8 disallow harmful lazy-loading, set explicit LCP/INP ceilings, and demand JSON interaction specs, acceptance tables, and perf checklists to materialize intent.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L26-L34】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-driven deliverables translate abstract goals into auditable assets.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Model compliant behaviors via structured interaction JSON.
- Reasoning: The ✅ example demonstrates component states, ARIA roles, keyboard traps, and timing budgets within a canonical schema, offering a ready-made template for execution.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L36-L51】
- Meta-heuristic: Pattern exemplars standardize implementation grammar so teams can replicate accessible motion specs consistently.

**Step 2:** Flag failure modes triggered by uniform timing, indiscriminate lazy-loading, and keyboard neglect.
- Reasoning: The ❌ anti-pattern exposes brittle assumptions that degrade performance metrics and exclude keyboard users, reinforcing why each strict rule exists.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L53-L63】
- Meta-heuristic: Contrastive diagnostics cement guardrails by showing the consequence of skipping required data and accessibility coverage.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Articulate validation storytelling through success and error narratives.
- Reasoning: The correct and incorrect JSON paired with the closing explanation trains communicators to report outcomes with evidence and consequence framing.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L36-L63】
- Meta-heuristic: Narrative pairing elevates status reporting from raw metrics to user-impact storytelling.

**Step 2:** Maintain instruction clarity with structured bulleting and emphasized strictness.
- Reasoning: Bracketed `[STRICT]` callouts, bullet hierarchies, and specific ranges provide repeatable grammar for subsequent briefs and specs.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc†L13-L34】
- Meta-heuristic: Consistent syntax codifies expectations so future updates stay aligned with interaction doctrine.
