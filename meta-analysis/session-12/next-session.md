# Session 13 Planning — Final Synthesis & Meta-Framework Consolidation

## Objectives
1. Construct the `/meta-analysis/final-synthesis/` workspace to house cross-session deliverables.
2. Author `complete-analysis.md` capturing unified frameworks, dependency chains, and evolution narratives across all 33 analyzed files.
3. Build `meta-framework-map.md` with an ASCII diagram showing relationships among workflow protocols, review utilities, master rules, and common rules.
4. Perform a governance sweep to confirm every session folder (01–12) contains analysis files, insights, and handoffs.
5. Update `AGENTS.md` success markers to reflect full corpus coverage and final synthesis completion.

## Evidence Requirements
- Reference representative citations from each protocol category to substantiate the unified synthesis.
- Document how clarification outputs (elaboration specialist) feed workflow, review, and UI rules to complete the operational loop.
- Map dependencies between automation governance (master rules) and UI execution (common rules) using explicit line anchors.

## Continuity Checkpoints
- Preserve the context chain captured in Session 12 insights, emphasizing evidence pipelines and enterprise gating.
- Carry forward deterministic orchestration themes introduced in earlier master rule analyses.
- Ensure final outputs reiterate quality gates (ASCII integrity, five-section compliance) as closing validation.
