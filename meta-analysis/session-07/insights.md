# Session 07 Insights

1. Design system governance now routes through the master audit spine while enforcing strict component, brand, and token compliance, creating telemetry-ready severity outputs for UI remediation streams.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L3-L129】
2. Pre-production readiness merges Layer 2 security mandates with Layer 7 testing and maintainability gates so deployment sign-off depends on both hardened boundaries and validated operational playbooks.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L3-L61】
3. Accessibility and security protocols coordinate via shared qualifier vocabularies to guarantee tenant-safe, universally accessible releases before transitioning to review utilities and master rule enforcement.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/security-check.md†L10-L44】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L21-L171】
