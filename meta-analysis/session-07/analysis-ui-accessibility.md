# Meta-Instruction Analysis: .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Reaffirm the protocol as a specialized mode of the master quality audit focused on UI/UX accessibility.
- Reasoning: The introduction states it is a pointer to the comprehensive audit, identifies Mode 7, and lists governing layers and usage.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L3-L18】
- Meta-heuristic: Dependency chaining sustains deterministic orchestration by delegating heavy governance to the audit spine while specializing the focus area.【F:meta-analysis/session-04/analysis-3-process-tasks.md†L72-L92】

**Step 2:** Define mission objectives around accessibility, responsiveness, UX patterns, and interaction consistency.
- Reasoning: The UI/UX Focus section enumerates WCAG compliance, responsive validation, UX verification, and flow consistency as primary objectives.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L12-L17】
- Meta-heuristic: Compliance-first planning ensures accessibility imperatives lead before procedural instructions, mirroring prior review protocols.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L4-L23】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Impose strict accessibility and inclusive design behaviors.
- Reasoning: The Accessibility Compliance cluster uses `[STRICT]` directives for contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, ARIA, semantics, and labels, while Inclusive Design enforces alternative content and inclusive support.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L21-L35】
- Meta-heuristic: Boundary guardianship now polices user experience boundaries, ensuring no user group is excluded—extending the workflow’s compliance ethos to UX.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L66-L88】

**Step 2:** Mandate responsive design, UX pattern consistency, and performance UX behaviors.
- Reasoning: Responsive, UX Patterns, Performance UX, and Multi-Tenant UX sections introduce strict directives on breakpoints, interaction feedback, cognitive load, and Core Web Vitals.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L36-L81】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-first UX ensures tangible metrics and behavioral requirements govern the audit before subjective feedback is considered.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-architecture-review.md†L24-L39】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Sequence audits through accessibility, responsiveness, UX flow, and performance analyses.
- Reasoning: The UI/UX Review Process details sequential audits for accessibility, responsive testing, UX flows, and performance analysis.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L82-L111】
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic sequencing mirrors the quality audit’s layered gate flow, ensuring prerequisites are validated in order.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L22-L70】

**Step 2:** Encode communication style and reporting templates with severity taxonomies and metrics.
- Reasoning: Communication and report sections define severity glyphs, pragmatic prompts, and a Markdown report template with accessibility and performance metrics.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L112-L171】
- Meta-heuristic: Telemetry-ready reporting sustains the audit router’s requirement for structured data and prioritized remediation guidance.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L56-L83】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Apply consistent qualifier vocabulary across accessibility directives.
- Reasoning: `[STRICT]`, `[PRAGMATISM]`, and severity glyphs appear throughout, guiding reviewer tone and balancing enforcement with practical advice.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L21-L135】
- Meta-heuristic: Shared lexicon with other review modes keeps multi-protocol orchestration coherent for the audit router lattice.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L14-L35】

**Step 2:** Provide explicit metric placeholders to maintain quantitative evidence capture.
- Reasoning: The report template requires scores for accessibility, responsive design, UX patterns, performance, and Core Web Vitals, ensuring measurable outputs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/ui-accessibility.md†L138-L170】
- Meta-heuristic: Quantified evidence supports retrospective telemetry loops highlighted in Session 05’s governance insights.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L90-L107】
