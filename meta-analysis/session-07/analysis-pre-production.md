# Meta-Instruction Analysis: .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Frame the mission around comprehensive security and production readiness before enumerating controls.
- Reasoning: The mission statement declares a combined focus on security validation, testing coverage, and maintainability, grounding the audit’s strategic scope.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L3-L6】
- Meta-heuristic: Compliance-first planning maintains continuity with workflow governance by defining intent before operational steps.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-architecture-review.md†L4-L18】

**Step 2:** Map the audit to Layer 2 and Layer 7 validation to ensure multi-layer orchestration.
- Reasoning: The document explicitly positions itself as a Layer 2 & 7 audit, signaling focus on security/multi-tenant assurance plus testing & maintainability.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L6-L8】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L37-L52】
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic orchestration couples infrastructure security gates with release-readiness metrics, echoing telemetry loops documented in Session 05 retrospectives.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L90-L107】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Enforce strict module security and multi-tenant protections as non-negotiable behaviors.
- Reasoning: `[STRICT]` and `[CRITICAL]` controls demand module-level authentication, secret isolation, tenant validation, and audit trails.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L10-L21】
- Meta-heuristic: Boundary guardianship extends to data segregation, sustaining the multi-tenant safeguards introduced in earlier architecture analyses.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-architecture-review.md†L12-L23】

**Step 2:** Extend behavioral checks to vulnerability scanning and secure communication enforcement.
- Reasoning: The security audit points and secure communication directives require specific vulnerability checks and configuration validation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L22-L35】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-first security review compels auditors to enumerate each threat class before release, aligning with the audit router’s severity taxonomy.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L56-L83】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Integrate testing coverage and maintainability validation into the sequential workflow.
- Reasoning: Layer 7 requirements enumerate unit, integration, E2E, security, and performance tests along with maintainability practices such as modularity, documentation, and rollback plans.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L37-L53】
- Meta-heuristic: Multi-pronged validation ensures that security fixes flow through tested, maintainable deployment pathways before sign-off.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-4-quality-audit.md†L98-L117】

**Step 2:** Define an ordered audit process culminating in dependency scanning for vulnerabilities.
- Reasoning: The Audit Process section prescribes a four-step sequence covering deep security, testing coverage, maintainability, and dependency audits.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L54-L58】
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic progression mirrors the workflow’s gate model, guaranteeing dependency health verification after primary controls are inspected.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L22-L70】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Leverage `[STRICT]`, `[CRITICAL]`, and `[MUST VERIFY]` qualifiers to encode priority and evidence expectations.
- Reasoning: Each checklist cluster uses qualifier tags to distinguish absolute requirements from verification tasks.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L10-L53】
- Meta-heuristic: Severity-aware language maintains coherence with the review lexicon established across previous sessions, aiding telemetry consolidation.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L14-L35】

**Step 2:** Direct auditors to produce comprehensive reports encompassing security and readiness findings.
- Reasoning: The Report Format mandates combining standard security audit results with detailed testing and maintainability analyses.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/pre-production.md†L60-L61】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence bundling ensures downstream retrospectives inherit a unified artifact for remediation tracking.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L90-L107】
