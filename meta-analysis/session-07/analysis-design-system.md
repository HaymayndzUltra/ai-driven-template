# Meta-Instruction Analysis: .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Re-anchor the protocol as a specialization of the master quality audit before reviewing localized guidance.
- Reasoning: The document explicitly states it is a pointer to the comprehensive audit and names the primary protocol connection and execution mode.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L3-L17】
- Meta-heuristic: Dependency chaining preserves deterministic orchestration by keeping all review modes governed by the core audit spine documented in Session 04 analyses.【F:meta-analysis/session-04/analysis-3-process-tasks.md†L72-L92】

**Step 2:** Set mission focus around design system conformance as the systemic anchor for downstream checks.
- Reasoning: The Design Focus section enumerates visual consistency, component usage patterns, and brand adherence as the governing objectives.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L12-L17】
- Meta-heuristic: Compliance-first planning continues the workflow theme of aligning reviews with high-level governance pillars before procedural details.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-architecture-review.md†L4-L18】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Enforce strict component and visual policies to regulate reviewer attention.
- Reasoning: The protocol issues `[STRICT]` directives on component usage, spacing, typography, and responsiveness under the Design System Compliance cluster.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L21-L33】
- Meta-heuristic: Boundary guardianship now manifests as design system boundaries, mirroring the architectural isolation mandates mapped in prior sessions.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-architecture-review.md†L12-L23】

**Step 2:** Bind brand guidelines and component architecture into the behavioral guardrails.
- Reasoning: The Brand and Component sections prescribe strict adherence to identity assets, reuse policies, and separation of presentation/business logic while cautioning against premature abstraction.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L34-L47】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-weighted pragmatism balances strict compliance with maintainability, echoing retrospective heuristics captured earlier.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L66-L88】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Sequence audits through design system, brand, and architecture passes to maintain deterministic flow.
- Reasoning: The Design Review Process enumerates a stepwise audit order that begins with component usage, advances to brand checks, and concludes with architecture analysis.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L56-L74】
- Meta-heuristic: Step-locked workflows prevent skipping prerequisites, sustaining the compliance-first orchestration emphasized in the quality audit spine.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L22-L70】

**Step 2:** Encode reporting pathways that categorize findings by severity and remediation priority.
- Reasoning: The communication style and report format define critical/improvement/suggestion taxonomies and prescribe Markdown templates with prioritized recommendations.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L76-L129】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-first reporting channels align with the audit router’s requirement for severity-tagged outputs for telemetry aggregation.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L56-L83】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Maintain strict qualifier vocabulary to convey mandatory vs advisory guidance.
- Reasoning: `[STRICT]`, `[CRITICAL]`, and `[PRAGMATISM]` markers appear throughout the framework, differentiating enforcement levels and pragmatic notes for reviewers.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L21-L98】
- Meta-heuristic: Consistent severity lexicon keeps cross-protocol communication synchronized for the audit router lattice referenced in Session 06.【F:meta-analysis/session-06/analysis-code-review.md†L14-L35】

**Step 2:** Provide fully structured Markdown outputs to preserve machine-ingestible evidence.
- Reasoning: The report template mandates Markdown headings, severity glyphs, and status callouts, ensuring formatting continuity for automation ingestion.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/design-system.md†L101-L129】
- Meta-heuristic: Structured communication ensures telemetry compatibility with evidence pipelines modeled in Session 05 retrospectives.【F:meta-analysis/session-05/analysis-5-implementation-retrospective.md†L90-L107】
