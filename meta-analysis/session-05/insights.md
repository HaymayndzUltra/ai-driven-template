# Session 05 Insights

1. Protocol 4 cements automation artifacts from planning and execution as prerequisites for quality review, requiring CI, coverage, and router-led routing before any specialized checks begin.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L22-L70】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L71-L127】
2. The audit orchestrator’s mode hierarchy sets up a scalable review lattice where narrow scopes precede comprehensive sweeps, priming the upcoming review protocols to inherit deterministic entry points.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L55-L113】
3. Protocol 5 transforms those audit artifacts into retrospective intelligence through mandatory rule audits, bias checks, and action validation, ensuring governance updates loop back into future task planning.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L19-L179】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L36-L87】
