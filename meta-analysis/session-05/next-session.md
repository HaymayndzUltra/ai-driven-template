# Next Session Plan

## Priority Files
1. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/architecture-review.md
2. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/review-protocols/code-review.md

## Continuity Guidance
- Align each review protocol’s entry conditions with the `/review` mode taxonomy and router fallbacks defined in the quality audit orchestrator so routing metadata stays deterministic.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L55-L113】
- Trace how retrospective evidence expectations will consume the reports generated by these reviews to keep the improvement loop fueled with the right artifacts.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L47-L143】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture protocol-specific quality gates, tooling commands, and reporting formats with explicit line references.
- Document dependencies on shared utilities (e.g., `_review-router.md`) or artifacts stored in `.artifacts/`.

## Session Goals
- Produce full five-section analyses with ASCII diagrams for both review protocols, emphasizing how they plug into the orchestrator pipeline.
- Extend the dependency map from workflow phases into the specialized review stack, noting any new telemetry or governance hooks introduced.
