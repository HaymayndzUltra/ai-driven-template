## DETAILED ANALYSIS RESULTS

### analysis-4-quality-audit.md Analysis
#### PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Fix the persona as a Senior Quality Engineer orchestrating unified reviews.
- Reasoning: The protocol frames the agent as an Audit Orchestrator whose mission is to route to the correct specialized protocol for each `/review` mode.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L14-L19】
- Meta-heuristic: Role-anchored orchestration to keep governance centralized.

**Step 2:** Gate all reviews behind mandatory pre-audit automation evidence.
- Reasoning: The `[CRITICAL]` pre-audit section requires running CI workflows, aggregating coverage, and storing artifacts before any routing occurs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L22-L54】
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-first validation to guarantee telemetry continuity from earlier automation hooks.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L71-L127】

**Step 3:** Bind the orchestrator to the centralized router for deterministic protocol selection.
- Reasoning: Execution flow explicitly defers to the router utility to resolve the narrowest matching protocol per mode.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L58-L64】
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic dispatch to maintain review coverage discipline across modes.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L154-L183】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 4:** Require explicit mode flags to scope the audit horizon.
- Reasoning: Mode determination insists on a declared `--mode` flag, enumerating options from `quick` to `comprehensive` with scoped intents.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L55-L113】
- Meta-heuristic: Intent-scoped branching to prevent unnecessary review load.

**Step 5:** Prefer specialized protocols before escalating to multi-pass audits.
- Reasoning: The guideline mandates using the narrowest protocol satisfying the request prior to invoking comprehensive sweeps.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L61-L113】
- Meta-heuristic: Minimal sufficient governance to balance rigor with efficiency.

**Step 6:** Constrain behavior to router-led fallbacks when custom protocols are absent.
- Reasoning: Router description highlights automatic fallback from project-specific rules to generic templates when needed.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L58-L64】
- Meta-heuristic: Resilient routing ensures audits never stall on missing bespoke assets.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 7:** Execute CI and coverage scripts sequentially and persist results.
- Reasoning: Commands for `run_workflow.py` and `aggregate_coverage.py` specify waiting for completion and saving JSON outputs inside `.artifacts/`.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L26-L54】
- Meta-heuristic: Scripted automation pipelines to standardize audit prerequisites.

**Step 8:** Load chosen protocol instructions verbatim and execute them end-to-end.
- Reasoning: Protocol execution stage insists on executing instructions defined within the routed specialized file without deviation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L65-L67】
- Meta-heuristic: Delegated procedure execution to preserve domain-specific rigor.

**Step 9:** Consolidate outputs into unified audit reports after protocol completion.
- Reasoning: Unified reporting stage mandates aggregating specialized findings into a standardized output channel.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L68-L70】
- Meta-heuristic: Post-processing normalization for comparable audit telemetry.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 10:** Broadcast automation completions using fixed `[AUTOMATION]` announcements.
- Reasoning: Steps 2 and 4 of pre-audit require explicit status messages with structured placeholders (coverage, workflow status).【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L35-L52】
- Meta-heuristic: Structured signaling to synchronize humans with machine-run checks.

**Step 11:** Communicate review routing and reporting through `/review` taxonomy.
- Reasoning: Mode listings map `/review` intents to protocol names, reinforcing consistent messaging for stakeholders.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L71-L113】
- Meta-heuristic: Controlled vocabulary to avoid audit ambiguity.

**Step 12:** Surface router dependencies when explaining execution context.
- Reasoning: Router reference explicitly calls out `.cursor/.../_review-router.md`, clarifying provenance when the agent describes routing decisions.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L58-L64】
- Meta-heuristic: Transparency grammar to maintain trust in automated selection.
