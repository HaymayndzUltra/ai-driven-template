# Meta-Instruction Analysis: advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc

## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Assume the advanced meta-instruction intelligence persona with a multi-dimensional mission charter.
- Reasoning: The rule positions the agent as a deep analyzer tasked with explaining purpose, operation, impact, and context for any rule.
- Meta-heuristic: Persona framing establishes an omnidirectional analysis mandate covering structural, cognitive, and systemic views before any tooling is invoked.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L6-L18】

**Step 2:** Activate seven-layer analysis as the foundational operating contract.
- Reasoning: The framework prescribes structural anatomy through evolutionary context, making completion of all layers mandatory or critical.
- Meta-heuristic: Layered scaffolding enforces exhaustive coverage, preventing partial or shallow assessments from satisfying the protocol.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L230】

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Trigger command-driven entry points and enforce directive taxonomies.
- Reasoning: Activation commands define how analyses are initiated, while Layer 1 requires directive hierarchy mapping and directive conflict detection.
- Meta-heuristic: Controlled entry ensures analysts declare context and track directive intensity before deeper reasoning proceeds.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L11-L37】

**Step 2:** Require structured reporting templates with mandatory evidence, gaps, and recommendations.
- Reasoning: Output format requirements and quality assurance protocols dictate the report structure, evidence backing, risk identification, and validation checkpoints.
- Meta-heuristic: Behavioral norms around reporting guarantee consistent deliverables across analyses, regardless of subject rule complexity.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L231-L387】

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Execute sequential layer checks spanning structure, cognition, integration, execution, impact, quality, and evolution.
- Reasoning: Each layer includes enumerated tasks (classification, metadata parsing, dependency mapping, trigger analysis, impact assessment, gap detection, evolutionary context) with explicit sub-steps.
- Meta-heuristic: Step-by-step logic transforms the broad mission into actionable checkpoints, minimizing omission risk.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L230】

**Step 2:** Extend analysis with comparative, visualization, simulation, conflict resolution, optimization, and templating capabilities.
- Reasoning: Advanced capabilities specify procedures for comparisons, dependency graphs, impact simulations, conflict strategies, optimization, and template generation.
- Meta-heuristic: Augmenting the base layers with specialized toolkits enables adaptive depth proportional to system complexity.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L312-L356】

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Enforce executive summaries, critical findings, and recommendations with explicit evidence statements.
- Reasoning: The output template mandates an executive summary plus critical findings and recommendations, while quality assurance insists on evidence-backed conclusions and risk assessments.
- Meta-heuristic: Communicative framing ensures stakeholders immediately grasp key insights and actions without scanning entire reports.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L235-L310】【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L357-L365】

**Step 2:** Embed error prevention heuristics and success checklists for completion validation.
- Reasoning: Error prevention requires flagging assumptions, gaps, and uncertainties, while the success criteria checklist enumerates completion conditions for every analysis.
- Meta-heuristic: Self-auditing grammar reduces silent failures by compelling analysts to document unresolved questions and confirm fulfillment of every analytical layer.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L368-L387】

## COMMENTARY
**Architectural Dependencies:**
- The mission charter and activation commands set expectations that the seven-layer framework operationalizes; omitting the charter would remove justification for the exhaustive layer completion requirement.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L6-L230】
- The output template depends on prior layers to populate structural, cognitive, and impact insights, while quality assurance ensures each populated section is evidence-backed.
- Advanced capabilities extend the base layers; comparative or simulation features presume structural and integration data already captured earlier in the process.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L356】

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- Evidence-first diagnostics: Every conclusion must reference tangible content, enforced by output and QA directives.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L235-L365】
- Exhaustive coverage loops: Layer enumeration and success criteria demand completion of all analytic dimensions before closure.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L387】
- Adaptive depth scaffolding: Optional comparative and visualization tools allow scaling analysis fidelity to system complexity without sacrificing baseline requirements.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L312-L356】

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- Planner: Layer 1 structural mapping and metadata parsing set the analytical scope.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L42】
- Executor: Layers 2–5 process cognition, integration, execution, and system impact.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L43-L169】
- Validator: Layer 6 quality checks plus QA protocol ensure completeness and evidence sufficiency.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L170-L365】
- Auditor: Layer 7 evolutionary context combined with error prevention and success criteria documents open questions and confirms mission fulfillment.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L200-L387】

## INFERENCE SUMMARY
The system articulates a **seven-layer meta-diagnostic** framework defined by:
1. Mandatory traversal of structural through evolutionary analyses, preventing premature conclusions.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L230】
2. Standardized reporting grammar that encodes evidence citations, executive communication, and actionable recommendations.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L235-L365】
