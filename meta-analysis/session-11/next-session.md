# Next Session Plan

## Priority Files
1. .cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-interaction-a11y-perf.mdc
2. .cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-premium-brand-dataviz-enterprise-gated.mdc
3. .cursor/rules/elaboration-specialist.mdc

## Continuity Guidance
- Ensure interaction and performance mandates extend the foundation rule’s token rationale and acceptance checklist pattern so downstream teams retain traceable accessibility proofs.【F:.cursor/rules/common-rules/common-rule-ui-foundation-design-system.mdc†L20-L62】
- Cross-check premium/enterprise UI standards against the orchestrator’s dependency governance to confirm luxury-grade requirements still slot into dependency-respecting workflows.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/9-master-rule-protocol-orchestrator.mdc†L221-L305】
- Apply the advanced meta-intelligence layers to the elaboration specialist rule to document persona cognition, evidence loops, and evolutionary context before final synthesis.【F:.cursor/rules/master-rules/advanced-meta-instruction-intelligence-system.mdc†L21-L387】

## Evidence Requirements
- Capture how interaction rules map to concrete token updates or checklist expansions established in the foundation analysis.
- Document any enterprise gating triggers that alter protocol orchestration or automation bindings.
- Record how the elaboration specialist’s discovery heuristics reinforce or diverge from existing meta-instruction personas.

## Session Goals
- Deliver five-section analyses for the remaining UI common rules plus the elaboration specialist to complete the 33-file corpus.
- Update insights to reflect how interaction/performance and premium brand rules integrate with orchestration and automation guardrails.
- Prepare to initiate final synthesis folder once all analyses are complete.
