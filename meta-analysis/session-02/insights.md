# Session 02 Insights

## Meta-Framework Highlights
- Discovery protocols employ a seven-gate pipeline that front-loads evidence normalization and automation, signaling a governance-first philosophy before PRD work. (ref. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-client-discovery.md L19-L295)
- Rule generation command functions as a compliance-focused factory by combining exhaustive context scans with schema-driven outputs and CI hooks. (ref. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md L8-L139)

## Cross-Protocol Dependencies
- Protocol 00's artifact suite directly feeds the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command by supplying project briefs and constraints that inform stack classification. (ref. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-client-discovery.md L171-L227; .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md L18-L35)
- Both protocols emphasize automation validation prior to human handoff, reinforcing a broader ecosystem requirement for machine-verifiable checkpoints. (ref. .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-client-discovery.md L248-L295; .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md L71-L120)

## Patterns to Track Next Session
- Monitor how subsequent workflow phases reuse the communication grammar introduced in Protocol 00.
- Evaluate whether other commands mirror the rule-generation command's emphasis on legacy migration and evidence artifacts.
