## Context from Previous Sessions
**Meta-frameworks discovered:**
- Seven-phase discovery governance ensures downstream protocols receive validated, audit-ready briefs. (Session 02)
- Compliance-driven rule generation treats rule synthesis as part of a CI-governed pipeline. (Session 02)

**Architectural dependencies:**
- Protocol 00 artifacts (brief, acceptance criteria, risk register) act as prerequisites for both PRD creation and rule generation. (Session 02)
- Automation gates from Protocol 00 and the rule command highlight a repository-wide expectation for machine-verifiable checkpoints before handoffs. (Session 02)

## Execution Notes
- Maintain communication grammar established in Protocol 00 when summarizing gates or readiness states.
- Track how workflow phases reference or depend on the artifacts generated during discovery to ensure context continuity.
