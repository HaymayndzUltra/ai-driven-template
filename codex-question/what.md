What is the software development life cycle (SDLC)?
The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a set of stages, activities, and tasks that software projects go through. The process model outlines how software development teams build, test, deploy, and maintain their software to achieve top code quality on time and within budget.

SDLC begins with the planning phase, where the development team defines and analyzes the project requirements, goals, and timeline. After the planning phase, the team creates the prototype by designing, building, and integrating different components. Next, the developers evaluate the project, investigate any reported issues, and fix bugs so the software works efficiently before the official launch.

While the goal is to ensure a quality and timely development process, the development cycle also involves routine maintenance to ensure the software remains running without hitches.

Why is the software development life cycle important?
The software development process documents and accounts for each production stage, resulting in quality, timely, and cost-effective software solutions. Highlighting the scope, activities, and stakeholders involved in the development process can help team members better understand their roles and contributions.

The SDLC helps identify likely challenges and potential risks along the development cycle. As a result, teams can brainstorm solutions to problems before they happen, eliminating unnecessary delays in the development process and improving productivity.

Key benefits of the software development life cycle
There are several key benefits to using an SDLC process, and they fall into the five distinct categories highlighted below.

Improved project budgeting
Software development teams can see what resources are needed when, such as developers, designers, or specialized skills. During the planning and analysis phases, project managers can identify the project scope, objectives, and requirements, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the project’s budgetary needs.

Each phase of SDLC then contributes to better project budgeting by offering visibility into resource allocation and proactive adjustments. This helps teams move efficiently from one development stage to the next phase.

Increased visibility
Throughout the project, stakeholders can more easily see where it’s at in the SDLC. This can help teams adjust their workflows, answer customer questions, and identify unforeseen roadblocks.

Each phase has specific milestones and deliverables, allowing project managers to track the project’s progress. The SDLC also provides visibility into resource allocation, so teams can have the right human resources, tools, and infrastructure.

By conducting analysis and risk assessment at each phase, teams can identify and mitigate risks early on, minimizing their impact on the project’s timeline, budget, and quality.

Enhanced security
SDLC strategies can help software development teams identify and address security vulnerabilities early in development. Development teams can help ensure products are secure and protected against cyberthreats, which is particularly important in today’s digital age.

Software development teams can develop products that secure both the company’s and their customers’ data more efficiently by implementing secure coding practices, conducting regular security testing, and following industry best practices in the software development life cycle.

Increased customer satisfaction
By adopting SDLC strategies, development teams gain a deep understanding of project goals and end users’ expectations, allowing them to design software tailored to the target audience.

This approach allows for the creation of interfaces and functionalities that improve the user experience and address specific user needs effectively. For instance, a mobile app development team can use SDLC principles to test prototypes and determine the most user-friendly interface for different screen sizes and operating systems while incorporating key functionalities like live chat, checkout, or social media integration.

The SDLC enhances customer satisfaction by addressing pain points, incorporating essential features, and delivering a user-friendly product.

Regular updates
The software development life cycle doesn’t end when the product launches; it requires constant maintenance even after production and launching.

During these routine checks, development teams typically fix bugs and improve performance on existing functionalities based on consumer feedback. End users can enjoy frequent updates with new functionalities and a better experience with a more efficient software development process.

How SDLC works
The need for software development methodologies dates to the 1950s. At the time, computers were often larger than a refrigerator and programmed using punch cards and vacuum tubes.

Since then, software engineers have sought to create and implement methods to accelerate software development. Now, the SDLC is used to reduce time-to-market while building intuitive software for clients.

Today’s SDLC promotes:

Individuals over processes and tools
Adapting to new needs
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration
All software development life cycle models involve various stages. Although these strategies can vary from model to model, we’ll look at the following SDLC sequence:

Planning
Requirement gathering and analysis
Designing
Building and developing
Testing
Implementation
Deployment
Maintenance
Throughout these phases, teams often use iterative models that allow for repeated cycles of development and refinement. This approach, combined with practices like development, security, and operations (DevSecOps), helps ensure that application security is integrated from the start and maintained throughout the development project.

1. Planning
The planning phase begins the cycle. It’s the time to define the project goals and milestones, attaching a timeline, personnel or skill set, and budget for each activity. While each company may have a unique approach to development planning, this phase typically involves understanding the client’s expectations, listing project objectives, identifying the target audience, and highlighting project requirements.

For example, let’s say a company wants to create an e-commerce store. The planning phase would involve deciding on the target audience and suitable features, like live inventory tracking, video product catalogs, and integrated social media. The project lead can conduct surveys and analyses to know the exact expectations of the end users.

Once the team knows customer requirements and the product’s expected features, the design team can collect the client’s input to determine the project’s feasibility and set timelines, milestones, and budgets.

2. Requirement gathering and analysis
Requirement gathering involves collecting all relevant information from the client and using it to create the product, ensuring their expectations are met. To do so, business analysts and project managers meet with the client to discuss software requirements in detail.

The purpose of this meeting is to more thoroughly understand the client’s wants and needs, including a description of the software, who the end user will be, and its overall purpose. This information is then written into the software requirement specification (SRS) document.

Once the team creates the SRS document, they pass it to the client for approval. The SRS document can then serve as a guide throughout the designing and development processes.

3. Designing
During the design phase, the project team develops a working software prototype based on the desired features and user requirements.

The software design process typically requires designers to create and test several design elements and ideas before selecting the final prototype. The implication of the design to the entire software development process is that it guides the developers to create a working representation of the client’s expectations while considering user-friendliness and multiscreen compatibility.

For example, if a team is developing an online shop, the design phase might consider the back-end framework, shopping cart features, payment features, and user experience parameters. They might also consider how the checkout page should display to the customer.

4. Building and developing
In the building and development phase, developers define and create the application structure with specific components, set up databases and data stores, and write code for all system components. The goal is to replicate a functional version of the prototype using appropriate programming languages and frameworks.

To illustrate this phase, let’s consider a company wanting to design a software application to manage its customer relations and create a better customer experience. During this phase, developers and programmers might use tools like Java, Ruby, and Python to make the software application.

Proper scrutiny is required to mitigate any issues and bugs acquired during the build phase. All business requirements, design documents, and other information gathered are considered during the building process. This phase often incorporates continuous integration to ensure smooth integration of new code with existing components.

5. Testing
In the testing phase, developers—especially DevOps professionals—verify the software meets the predetermined requirements, designs, and other quality standards. Without proper software testing, the system may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that can go unnoticed and potentially lead to serious problems when put into use.

An example of this is deploying an application to a live environment like the Google Play Store. The application must be tested on various screens beforehand to ensure it works as intended. This includes validating data input, measuring application performance, and confirming security features are up to parameters.

Unit testing is a crucial part of this phase, where individual components are tested in isolation to ensure they function correctly. Additionally, quality assurance (QA) processes ensure the overall quality of the software meets or exceeds expectations.

6. Implementation
The implementation phase is where the design created in the design phase is implemented into the necessary application programming interfaces (APIs) and project components. The result of this phase is a fully functional product.

After implementation, the final product requires further testing to address all bugs and discrepancies before release. The team measures the software against the specifications in the SRS document and sends a test version to reviewers. The feedback gathered during this phase allows developers to make necessary product changes before full implementation.

7. Deployment
The deployment phase typically consists of putting the software into a production environment so it’s accessible to users. After successful deployment, customers can use the newly developed software. In some cases, the client may request user acceptance testing before deployment to ensure the software meets expectations.

User acceptance testing involves testing the newly created software and ensuring it performs correctly and meets specific requirements.

8. Maintenance
The maintenance phase is the final step and is just as crucial as the previous steps. Its primary function is to keep the software up to date and performing optimally. It requires ongoing software review, management, and improvement once cleared for public release.

Without the maintenance phase, the software might become unusable and fail to meet customer expectations. Typical approaches include directly editing the code, patching errors, and releasing updates when necessary.

Developers must continuously update the software to ensure it works on different devices and platforms, adapts to modern technologies, and uses current security measures. This ongoing process helps optimize the software’s performance and longevity.
