Workflow Alignment Choices
Integration depth: b) Deeply integrate with and extend the existing .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/ phases. CD-MIE becomes the meta-layer that prepares, audits, and maintains instruction assets that feed each of the established workflow phases, preserving the “Why before How” philosophy and evidence expectations already defined for project execution.

Automation script coverage: b) Document bindings for existing scripts and propose new lifecycle-specific utilities. We reuse validation, evidence, and quality scripts already mapped in scripts/README.md, then augment them with targeted CD-MIE helpers (e.g., lifecycle orchestrator, meta-instruction diffing) so the framework is actionable without duplicating capabilities.

Human validation gates: c) Comprehensive gates at planning, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The existing validation-gate system already enforces multi-phase human oversight, and CD-MIE should mirror that rigor for instruction governance.

Contract-Driven Meta-Instruction Engineering (CD-MIE) Lifecycle Framework
Overview
CD-MIE applies SDLC-grade discipline to AI instruction engineering by orchestrating eight phases—Planning through Maintenance—with explicit contracts, automation bindings, and human approvals. The framework ensures every rule, protocol, or command added to .cursor/rules/ or .cursor/commands/ is syntactically sound, semantically clear, behaviorally validated, and conflict-free, while staying aligned with master-rule expectations for YAML frontmatter, priority handling, and evidence capture.

Phase Contracts & Quality Gates
1. Planning
Objective: Define strategic intent, stakeholders, and success metrics for new or revised meta-instructions.

Acceptance Criteria Checklist
 Syntactic correctness: YAML frontmatter validated and normalized.

 Semantic clarity: Directives reviewed for ambiguity via formatter/consistency scripts.

 Behavioral correctness: Test scenarios executed with passing outcomes and evidence captured.

 Conflict-free integration: No collisions detected by conflict scanners; bindings verified.

Maintenance Protocol
Monitoring Mechanisms: Scheduled runs of retrospective_rules_audit.py, telemetry hooks into workflow orchestrator, diff alerts from proposed rule_lifecycle_manager.py.

Update Procedures: Semantic versioning per rule, change logs stored alongside artifact, rollback bundles maintained via backup_workflows.py, emergency rollback scripts available (restore_workflows.py).

Refactoring Guidelines: Trigger refactor when drift reports exceed thresholds, conflicting scopes emerge, or workflow phases change. Deprecate when rule no longer maps to any active phase; evolve when adjustments maintain compatibility with dependency graph.

Human-in-the-Loop Governance
Planning Review: Governance architect validates objectives and dependencies.

Requirement Approval: Requirements architect ensures trigger/scope completeness.

Design Review: Instruction architect + compliance officer evaluate blueprint.

Testing Sign-off: QA lead confirms behavioral coverage and evidence integrity.

Deployment Sign-off: Release manager and governance architect approve activation.

Maintenance Oversight: Quarterly board reviews telemetry, approves updates/retirements.

Evidence Requirements: Each gate must include planning brief, requirement spec, blueprint, test report, deployment record, and maintenance dossier stored via evidence_manager.py for traceability.
