CD-MIE Lifecycle Framework Overview
The Contract-Driven Meta-Instruction Engineering (CD-MIE) lifecycle formalizes how AI behavioral rules are conceived, validated, deployed, and evolved while remaining consistent with the existing AI-driven workflow protocols and master-rule governance mandated for this repository.

Phase Breakdown
Phase 1 – Planning (Meta-Instruction Strategy Alignment)
Objective: Define the reasoning objectives the new instruction must achieve and map them to existing workflow phases to guarantee coherence with the 5-phase AI-driven lifecycle.

Input Contract: Approved business/architect brief, inventory of current master/common rules, and identified workflow phase dependencies.

Output Contract: CD-MIE charter containing goal statements, scope boundaries, workflow touchpoints, and risk register.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: Charter template completed with enumerated objectives.

Semantic validation: Objectives uniquely trace back to user needs and workflow dependencies.

Behavioral validation: Hypothetical scenarios confirm planned behaviors align with workflow roles.

Conflict detection: Confirms no duplication with existing master rules.

Automation Bindings: plan_from_brief.py synthesizes charters; analyze_brief.py highlights risk anchors.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Lead AI architect signs off that objectives justify creating or updating an instruction, with documented rationale.

Phase 2 – Requirement Gathering (Context & Trigger Definition)
Objective: Capture triggers, scopes, tags, contexts, and evidence expectations that will feed the master-rule frontmatter and downstream automation.

Input Contract: Approved charter, list of target workflows/slash commands, and baseline context taxonomy.

Output Contract: Requirements dossier covering trigger matrix, scope taxonomy, context dependencies, and evidence obligations.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: Requirement template filled without omissions.

Semantic validation: No overlapping or ambiguous triggers across scopes.

Behavioral validation: Scenario mapping shows each trigger drives a distinct response.

Conflict detection: analyze_project_rules.py and classify_domain.py flag overlaps with existing rules.

Automation Bindings: analyze_project_rules.py, classify_domain.py, and proposed rule_trigger_matrix.py for gap analysis.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Requirements review board confirms coverage and approves traceability map.

Phase 3 – Designing (Rule Architecture & Controls)
Objective: Architect YAML frontmatter, cognitive checkpoints, and evidence gates that conform to master-rule conventions and align with workflow evidence requirements.

Input Contract: Requirements dossier, relevant workflow protocol excerpts, and slash command integration notes.

Output Contract: Design specification including frontmatter draft, checkpoint logic, evidence schemas, and gating diagrams.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: Frontmatter fields validate via standardize_frontmatter.py.

Semantic validation: Checkpoint narratives reviewed for clarity and non-ambiguity.

Behavioral validation: Decision trees simulate expected agent flow.

Conflict detection: detect_instruction_conflicts.py runs against existing rule graph.

Automation Bindings: standardize_frontmatter.py, optimize_project_rules.py, and proposed checkpoint_blueprint_generator.py ensure structural integrity.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Architecture council walkthrough to ratify checkpoints and guardrails.

Phase 4 – Building (Instruction Authoring & Packaging)
Objective: Author the .mdc or command markdown with compliant frontmatter and structured directives, ready for automation and slash-command binding.

Input Contract: Approved design spec, evidence schema definition, and assigned rule ID.

Output Contract: Draft .mdc/command file, evidence manifest, and changelog entry.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: system_instruction_formatter.py enforces formatting rules.

Semantic validation: Peer review ensures directive clarity and fidelity to intent.

Behavioral validation: Static execution walkthrough ensures flow matches design.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Senior instruction engineer approves authored rule before testing.

Phase 5 – Testing (Behavioral & Quality Validation)
Objective: Prove that the instruction behaves as designed across targeted workflows, meeting syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and conflict criteria.

Input Contract: Draft instruction package, test scenarios, and mock contexts.

Output Contract: Validation report with pass/fail per scenario, logs, and defect tickets.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: validate_ai_directives.py checks frontmatter, formatting, and metadata.

Output Contract: Deployment record, activation logs, user-facing announcement, and rollback artifacts.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: run_workflow.py load test ensures commands recognize instructions.

Semantic validation: review_protocol_loader.py verifies consistent workflow messaging.

Behavioral validation: validate_workflow_integration.py runs end-to-end rehearsal.

Conflict detection: enforce_gates.py ensures environment gating prevents conflicting rules from co-loading.

Automation Bindings: run_workflow.py, validate_workflow_integration.py, enforce_gates.py, and proposed live_rule_monitor.py.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Deployment board signs off on activation and monitors first-run telemetry.

Phase 8 – Maintenance (Monitoring, Evolution, and Retirement)
Objective: Continuously monitor rule performance, manage drift, and execute updates or deprecations while preserving historical evidence.

Input Contract: Active deployment metrics, feedback backlog, incident reports.

Output Contract: Maintenance logs, version history, updated instructions, or retirement notices.

Quality Gates & Success Criteria:

Syntactic validation: standardize_frontmatter.py rerun after any edits.

Semantic validation: Periodic clarity review using optimize_project_rules.py.

Behavioral validation: Regression via validation_gates.py on impacted contexts.

Conflict detection: retrospective_rules_audit.py and rules_audit_quick.py ensure compatibility.

Automation Bindings: retrospective_rules_audit.py, evidence_manager.py, migrate_evidence_data.py, lifecycle_tasks.py, plus proposed rule_retirement_planner.py.

Human-in-the-Loop Gate: Quarterly governance review to approve updates, plan refactors, or sunset rules with rollback strategy.

Acceptance Criteria Checklist
 Syntactic correctness – Frontmatter and file formatting validated by automation and peer review.

 Semantic clarity – Directives unambiguous across workflows and commands, reviewed by architects.

 Behavioral correctness – Scenario suite demonstrates intended AI actions with evidence artifacts.

 Conflict-free integration – Collision scans confirm compatibility with master/common rules and workflows.

Maintenance Protocol
Monitoring Mechanisms: Scheduled retrospective_rules_audit.py runs, telemetry from live_rule_monitor.py, and evidence rollups maintained by evidence_manager.py to detect drift or misfires.

Update Procedures: Version bump via rule_lifecycle_manager.py, automated regression (validation_gates.py), and documented rollback scripts (rollback_backend.sh, rollback_frontend.sh) before release.

Refactoring Guidelines: Triggered when recurring waivers surface, telemetry shows degraded outcomes, or workflows evolve—evaluate redesign vs. deprecation with architecture review citing master-rule priorities.

Human-in-the-Loop Governance
Mandatory architect checkpoints at Planning, Requirement, Design, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance retrospectives ensure alignment with existing workflows, command behaviors, and master-rule precedence before automation proceeds.

Evidence package for each gate must include automation outputs, meeting notes, and explicit pass/fail decisions for traceability within the AI-driven workflow’s evidence expectations.

Responses to Alignment Questions
Integration depth: b) Deeply integrate with and extend existing .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/ phases so the CD-MIE lifecycle dovetails with the established five-phase protocol structure and evidence expectations.

Automation script coverage: b) Document bindings for existing automation while proposing targeted new utilities (e.g., rule_lifecycle_manager.py) to cover lifecycle gaps; this leverages the rich script inventory already present in scripts/ and adds only mission-critical enhancements.

Human validation gates: c) Comprehensive gates at planning, design, testing, deployment, and maintenance align with the repository’s emphasis on reasoning integrity, evidence, and controlled activation of rules.
