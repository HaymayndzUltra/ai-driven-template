I want to establish a systematic, production-grade lifecycle framework for engineering AI meta-instructions (protocols, rules, behavioral contracts) with the same rigor that SDLC brings to software development. This ensures AI instructions are:
Systematically designed (not ad-hoc)
Validated and tested (behavioral correctness)
Maintainable and evolvable (lifecycle management)
Contract-driven (clear input/output/success criteria at each phase)
Action
Design and document an 8-phase CD-MIE lifecycle framework that governs how AI instructions are engineered, validated, deployed, and maintained. Each phase must:
Define clear contracts: Input requirements, output artifacts, success criteria
Map automation bindings: Which scripts (e.g., rule_validator.py, evidence_manager.py) support which phase
Establish quality gates: Validation checkpoints to ensure meta-instructions are syntactically valid, semantically clear, behaviorally correct, and conflict-free
Include human-in-the-loop gates: Decision points where human architects validate before proceeding
Details
Scope: Meta-level governance—this framework governs how AI instructions themselves are engineered, not how software is built.
8 CD-MIE Phases (mirroring SDLC):
Planning → Define meta-instruction objectives (what reasoning behavior should the AI exhibit?)
Requirement Gathering → Analyze triggers, scopes, tags, contexts needed
Designing → Architect rule structure (YAML frontmatter, cognitive checkpoints, evidence gates)
Building → Write the meta-instruction (protocol markdown with strict directives)
Testing → Validate instruction against test scenarios (does AI behave as expected?)
Implementation → Deploy instruction to .cursor/rules/ or .cursor/commands/
Deployment → Activate instruction in live AI agent workflows
Maintenance → Monitor, update, refactor based on feedback
Integration Points:
Must align with existing .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/ protocols
Must respect .cursor/rules/master-rules/ governance
Must integrate with automation scripts (evidence_manager, quality_gate_runner, etc.)
Quality Gates Per Phase:
Syntactic validation: YAML frontmatter correct
Semantic validation: No ambiguous directives
Behavioral validation: AI executes as intended
Conflict detection: No rule collisions or overrides
Expected Outcome
A comprehensive CD-MIE framework document that includes:
8 Lifecycle Phase Definitions with:
Phase objectives
Input contracts (what must exist before this phase starts)
Output contracts (what artifacts this phase produces)
Success criteria (how to validate phase completion)
Automation Binding Map:
Protocol phase → checkpoint → script binding → success criteria
Example: Testing phase → behavioral validation checkpoint → rule_validator.py → AI executes correctly
Phase Templates:
Requirement gathering template (triggers, scopes, contexts)
Design template (rule structure, checkpoints, evidence gates)
Testing template (test scenarios, expected behaviors)
Acceptance Criteria Checklist:
Syntactic correctness ✓
Semantic clarity ✓
Behavioral correctness ✓
Conflict-free integration ✓
Maintenance Protocol:
Monitoring mechanisms (how to detect rule drift or obsolescence)
Update procedures (versioning, rollback)
Refactoring guidelines (when to evolve vs deprecate)
Human-in-the-Loop Gates:
Which phases require architect validation
What evidence must be presented
Approve/reject criteria
This framework will enable systematic, repeatable, and high-quality AI instruction engineering with SDLC-level rigor.

Questions for GPT-5-CODEX (IMPORTANT)
This is for gpt-5-codex (YOU) so whats the best options para mas maging aligned sayo ang workflow
Integration depth with existing protocols?
a) CD-MIE should be a standalone framework that can optionally reference existing protocols
b) CD-MIE should deeply integrate with and extend the existing .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/ phases
c) CD-MIE should replace/supersede the current workflow protocols
d) if none of the above suggest your best idea
Automation script coverage?
a) Document bindings for existing scripts only (evidence_manager.py, quality_gate_runner, etc.)
b) Also propose new scripts needed to support CD-MIE phases (e.g., rule_lifecycle_manager.py, conflict_detector.py)
c) Full automation suite with implementation plans for all proposed scripts
d) if none of the above suggest your best idea
Human validation gates?
a) Minimal human gates (only at deployment approval)
b) Moderate gates (design validation + deployment approval)
c) Comprehensive gates (planning validation, design review, testing approval, deployment sign-off, maintenance oversight)
d) if none of the above suggest your best idea
