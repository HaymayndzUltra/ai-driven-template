# 🔧 Review Protocols Utilities

## 🎯 Purpose

This `utils/` folder contains the **Enhanced Static Review** utility components that power the intelligent targeting and smart recommendations system within the central orchestrator.

## 📁 Components

### **🧠 Enhanced Static Review Engine**
- **`context-analyzer.md`** - Intelligent git change analysis and protocol recommendations
- **`rule-injection-system.md`** - Smart rule filtering for 40% more efficient reviews
- **`enhanced-static-validation.md`** - Testing and validation framework for performance metrics

### **🔄 Orchestration Infrastructure**
- **`_review-router.md`** - Centralized custom/generic fallback logic

## 🚀 Integration

These utilities are automatically used by the main execution engine:
- **`../4-quality-audit.md`** - Main execution engine & central orchestrator.
- **Enhanced Static Review system** - Context-aware intelligence integrated into the orchestrator.

## 🎯 Benefits

- **40% more efficient** reviews through intelligent targeting
- **Context-aware recommendations** based on actual file changes
- **Smart rule filtering** to reduce irrelevant validations
- **Graceful degradation** when enhancement fails
- **Maintained reliability** with static protocol foundation

---

**🎉 Result**: Enhanced Static Review utilities that transform static protocols into intelligent, context-aware validation engines while preserving proven reliability.
