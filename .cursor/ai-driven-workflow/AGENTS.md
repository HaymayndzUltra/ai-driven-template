# ðŸ¤– AGENTS.md - AI-Driven Workflow Protocol Guide

## Purpose
This document explains how AI agents (including GPT-5-Codex) should interpret and execute the AI-driven workflow protocols in this directory.

## Understanding AI-Driven Workflow

### What is AI-Driven Workflow?
The AI-driven workflow is a **5-phase development lifecycle** that transforms AI from a simple code generator into a reliable engineering partner. Each protocol represents a specific reasoning phase that mirrors how senior developers work.

### Core Philosophy
- **"Why Before How"**: Every action must align with cognitive dependencies
- **Developer Cognitive Loop**: Protocols follow natural developer thinking patterns
- **Reasoning Integrity**: Automation extends reasoning, never replaces it
- **Evidence-Based**: All actions must be validated and documented

## Protocol Structure

## Review Protocols Integration

### Review Protocol Structure
Located in `review-protocols/` directory:
- **code-review.md**: Code quality validation
- **security-check.md**: Security compliance
- **architecture-review.md**: Architecture validation
- **design-system.md**: UI/UX compliance
- **ui-accessibility.md**: Accessibility validation
- **pre-production.md**: Pre-deployment validation

### Review Protocol Usage
Review protocols are triggered by:
1. **Quality Audit Phase**: Automatic execution during Phase 4
2. **Manual Trigger**: Explicit user request
3. **Context Detection**: Automatic based on code changes
4. **Integration Hooks**: CI/CD pipeline integration

## Evidence Collection System

### Evidence Types
Each protocol must collect specific evidence:

1. **Analysis Evidence**: Understanding and comprehension
2. **Implementation Evidence**: Code and configuration
3. **Validation Evidence**: Testing and verification
4. **Process Evidence**: Workflow execution details

### Evidence Format
```json
{
  "protocol": "protocol-name",
  "phase": "phase-number",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "evidence": {
    "analysis": "analysis details",
    "implementation": "implementation details",
    "validation": "validation results",
    "process": "process documentation"
  },
  "quality_gates": {
    "gate1": "passed",
    "gate2": "passed"
  }
}
```

## Quality Gates

### Gate Types
1. **Prerequisite Gates**: Must pass before protocol execution
2. **Execution Gates**: Must pass during protocol execution
3. **Completion Gates**: Must pass before protocol completion
4. **Integration Gates**: Must pass for workflow integration

### Gate Validation
Each gate requires:
- **Clear Criteria**: Specific validation requirements
- **Evidence Collection**: Documentation of gate passage
- **Failure Handling**: What to do if gate fails
- **Recovery Process**: How to retry failed gates

## Integration with Cursor

### Cursor Commands Integration

@apply .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md --mode comprehensive
```

### Context Awareness
Protocols leverage Cursor's context features:
- **@codebase**: Full project context

- **@filename**: File-specific context
- **@recent-changes**: Recent modification analysis

## Automation Integration

### Script Integration
Protocols integrate with automation scripts:
- **Bootstrap Scripts**: Project initialization automation
- **Generation Scripts**: Code and documentation generation
- **Validation Scripts**: Quality and compliance checking
- **Deployment Scripts**: Release and deployment automation

### CI/CD Integration
Workflow protocols integrate with CI/CD:
- **Quality Gates**: Automated validation in pipelines
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated documentation
- **Process Validation**: Workflow compliance checking
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### Protocol Execution
1. **Follow Sequence**: Execute protocols in order
2. **Collect Evidence**: Document all actions and decisions
3. **Validate Gates**: Ensure all quality gates pass
4. **Maintain Context**: Keep context throughout execution

### Evidence Management
1. **Document Everything**: Record all analysis and decisions
2. **Validate Evidence**: Ensure evidence is complete and accurate
3. **Store Persistently**: Save evidence for future reference
4. **Link Dependencies**: Connect evidence across protocols

2. **Execute Thoroughly**: Complete all protocol steps
3. **Validate Results**: Ensure outcomes meet requirements
4. **Document Findings**: Record all validation results

## Error Handling

### Protocol Failures
When protocols fail:
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine why failure occurred
2. **Document Failure**: Record failure details and context
3. **Implement Fix**: Address the underlying issue
4. **Retry Protocol**: Re-execute from appropriate point

### Quality Gate Failures
When quality gates fail:
1. **Stop Execution**: Halt protocol execution
2. **Analyze Failure**: Understand why gate failed
3. **Implement Fix**: Address the issue
4. **Re-validate**: Re-run gate validation

### Integration Failures
When integrations fail:
1. **Fallback Mode**: Use alternative approaches
2. **Manual Override**: Allow human intervention
3. **Document Issue**: Record integration problems
4. **Update Protocols**: Improve based on learnings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

## Conclusion

The AI-driven workflow provides a structured approach to AI-assisted development. By understanding the protocol structure, execution logic, and evidence requirements, AI agents can effectively guide development from initial concept to production deployment.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Sequential Execution**: Protocols must be executed in order
- **Evidence Required**: All actions must be documented
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints must be passed
- **Integration**: Protocols work together as a cohesive system
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learnings feed back into protocol enhancement

This system ensures that AI agents can provide consistent, high-quality assistance while maintaining the reasoning integrity and evidence-based approach that makes the workflow effective.
