# The Governor Workflow: From Idea to Production

## 1. Why: A Structured Workflow for Predictable Results

Working with AI can sometimes feel unpredictable. The AI Governor Framework provides a development workflow designed to fix that, for both new and existing projects.

It provides a structured, sequential process that transforms your AI from a simple code generator into a reliable engineering partner. By following these protocols, you ensure that both you and the AI are always aligned, moving from a high-level idea to a well-implemented feature with clarity, control, and consistency.

The goal is to make AI-powered development:
-   **Predictable:** Each step has a clear purpose and output.
-   **Controllable:** You are always in the loop for key decisions.
-   **Efficient:** The AI does the heavy lifting, you provide the strategic direction.

## 2. Protocol Architecture Map

The workflow consists of **33 protocols** organized in **5 phases** with **dependency-based flow**:

### Integration Checkpoints

Each protocol includes automation checkpoints that validate:
- **Script Execution**: All automation scripts run successfully
- **Quality Gates**: Validation scores meet thresholds
- **Evidence Capture**: Artifacts are properly stored
- **State Synchronization**: Task state is updated correctly

### Quality Gates per Protocol

| Protocol | Gate Criteria | Validation Threshold |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 00 | Brief validation, risks scored, domain classified | Brief score ≥ 80 |
| 0 | Rules normalized, audit report generated | All rules validated |
| 1 | Assets generated, PRD validation complete | PRD score ≥ 85 |
| 2 | Tasks validated and enriched | All tasks enhanced |
| 3 | Task state synced, evidence captured | State synchronized |
| 4 | CI workflows executed, coverage aggregated | CI status checked |
| 5 | Rule audit complete, evidence aggregated | Audit complete |

## 10. Protocol Selection Guide

### When to Use Which Protocol

| Phase | Protocol | When to Use | Prerequisites |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 0 | Bootstrap | New project setup, rule configuration | Project repository |
| 0 | Client Discovery | Job post analysis, requirement gathering | Raw requirements |
| 0 | Generate Rules | Project-specific rule creation | Bootstrap complete |
| 1 | Create PRD | Feature specification, technical design | Brief validated |
| 2 | Generate Tasks | Implementation planning, task breakdown | PRD complete |
| 3 | Process Tasks | Code implementation, execution | Tasks generated |
| 4 | Quality Audit | Code review, quality validation | Implementation complete |
| 5 | Retrospective | Process improvement, lessons learned | Quality audit complete |

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- **Phase 0** (Foundation): No dependencies, entry point
- **Phase 1-2** (Planning): Requires Phase 0 completion
- **Phase 3** (Execution): Requires Phase 1-2 completion
- **Phase 4** (Quality): Requires Phase 3 completion
- **Phase 5** (Retrospective): Requires Phase 4 completion

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Script not found
```
Error: python scripts/script_name.py: No such file or directory
```
**Fix:** Check script exists and is executable: `chmod +x scripts/script_name.py`

**Issue:** Automation gate failure
```
[GATE FAILED] Automation Validation Complete
```
**Fix:** Check automation script output for specific errors and address underlying issues

**Issue:** Evidence pipeline broken
```
Missing evidence artifacts in retrospective
```
**Fix:** Verify evidence capture in Protocol 3 and aggregation in Protocol 5

**Issue:** CI workflow integration issues
```
CI workflows not executing or results not captured
```
**Fix:** Verify GitHub Actions workflow files exist and `run_workflow.py` configuration

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate entire workflow integration
python scripts/validate_workflow_integration.py

# Run integration tests
bash scripts/test_workflow_integration.sh

# Check specific protocol
python scripts/validate_brief.py brief.md --verbose
```

## 14. Folder Overview and Key Files

This directory contains the end-to-end ai-driven-workflow protocols and the unified quality review system used throughout the repository.

### Directory structure (high level)

- `README.md` – Overview and usage of the 33-protocol lifecycle with automation
- `INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` – Detailed automation integration guide
- `VALIDATION-GUIDE.md` – Validation and quality gate details
- `0-bootstrap-your-project.md` – Protocol 0 bootstrap procedure
- `00-client-discovery.md` – Protocol 00 client discovery
- `00-generate-rules.md` – Protocol 00 rule generation command
- `1-create-prd.md` – Protocol 1 PRD creation
- `2-generate-tasks.md` – Protocol 2 task generation
- `3-process-tasks.md` – Protocol 3 controlled execution
- `4-quality-audit.md` – Unified review orchestrator and entry point
- `5-implementation-retrospective.md` – Protocol 5 retrospective
- `review-protocols/` – Library of specialized review protocols and utilities

### Key interactions

- Orchestrated reviews are invoked via `4-quality-audit.md` and leverage utilities under `review-protocols/utils/`.
- Protocol 3 mandates running Protocol 4 (comprehensive audit) and then Protocol 5 (retrospective) per parent task.

### Quick links (protocol entry points)

- Bootstrap → `0-bootstrap-your-project.md`
- Discovery → `00-client-discovery.md`
- Rules → `00-generate-rules.md`
- PRD → `1-create-prd.md`
- Tasks → `2-generate-tasks.md`
- Execute → `3-process-tasks.md`
- Review → `4-quality-audit.md`
- Retro → `5-implementation-retrospective.md`

### Notes on advanced features

- Interactive, tool‑agnostic review selection is centralized in `4-quality-audit.md` and routes through `_review-router.md` for automatic custom↔generic fallback.
- Automation checkpoints and evidence capture are integrated across protocols to maintain auditable execution.
- All 33 protocols documented with complete execution logic, quality gates, automation hooks, and outputs.
