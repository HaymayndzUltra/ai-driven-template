ito ang jobpost ng client sa upwork, kailangan kong gumawa ng proposal na pang expert developer ang gumawa


We’re building a next-generation enterprise platform - a fully multi-tenant system designed to be built by AI developer agents.

We’re looking for a senior AI systems architect who has hands-on experience orchestrating autonomous AI developer teams (CrewAI, AutoGen, SWE-Agent, or similar). Your role is not to code the platform yourself - it’s to design the architecture, agent ecosystem, and governance model that allows AI agents to do the coding autonomously, safely and consistently.

This is not a speculative R&D experiment. The goal is to build a working production-grade platform (multi-tenant, POS-integrated, payments, etc.) using a carefully managed fleet of autonomous developer agents - supervised and orchestrated through your architecture.

/**********************
* YOUR MISSION
**********************/

You will:
* Define the core architecture principles for a multi-tenant enterprise platform (security, data isolation, scalability, shared components).
* Design the AI orchestration framework - role definitions, agent communication flows, QA loops, evaluation, and context persistence.
* Establish guardrails to ensure that AI agents stay aligned with system architecture, naming conventions, data models, and tenancy boundaries.
* Set up the initial environment (CrewAI, AutoGen, or Replit Agents, with GitHub/GitLab integration, CI/CD, and automated testing pipelines).
* Oversee the autonomous build process for the first set of microservices - ensuring that agents hand off tasks cleanly and produce reliable, maintainable code.

You’ll work directly with the CTO (me) - no bureaucracy, no legacy teams - and help shape one of the first truly autonomous AI-led development environments in production.

/**********************
* WHO YOU ARE
**********************/

You are:
* A senior software architect or AI systems designer with hands-on experience orchestrating autonomous agent workflows.
* Comfortable working at the intersection of AI orchestration, distributed systems architecture, and DevOps automation.
* Deeply familiar with tools like CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, SWE-Agent, or custom agent frameworks.
* Able to talk fluently about agent communication, memory/state persistence, failure recovery, and evaluation.
* Passionate about designing self-organising engineering systems, not just writing prompts or code snippets.

/**********************
* SUCCESS CRITERIA
**********************/

You'll succeed in this role if you:
* Have already built or experimented with multi-agent autonomous coding systems.
* Understand the failure patterns of autonomous agents (prompt drift, version collisions, circular dependencies, hallucinated architecture decisions).
* Know how to enforce design manifests and architectural governance within LLM-driven systems.
* Can set up structured handoff layers (PM agent → dev agents → QA agent → deployment agent).
* Appreciate the balance between autonomy and control - when to let agents act, and when to intervene.
