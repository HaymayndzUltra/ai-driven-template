# Cognitive Proposal Generator

**[STRICT]** This command analyzes `JOB-POST.md` and generates cognitively-aligned, human-sounding proposals that demonstrate real understanding rather than mechanical keyword matching.

## Core Mission

Transform AI from text generator into context interpreter — recognizing not only what a client asks for, but why they're asking, and what mental frame (doer/thinker/feeler) they operate from.

## PHASE 1: Cognitive Classification Engine

**[STRICT]** Analyze the job post to determine underlying mental model:

### Classification Algorithm
```
INPUT: JOB-POST.md content
→ Parse for cognitive indicators
→ Classify as Technical/Strategic/Creative
→ Extract tone fingerprinting
→ Determine reasoning depth level
```

### Classification Criteria

**Technical (Doer)** Indicators:
- Task-based language ("build", "implement", "deliver")
- Concrete outcomes focus ("deadline", "milestone", "specification")
- Technical requirements lists
- Performance metrics emphasis
- Direct problem-solution framing

**Strategic (Thinker)** Indicators:
- Process-oriented language ("strategy", "framework", "approach")
- System thinking ("architecture", "scalability", "integration")
- Business context ("growth", "market", "competitive")
- Long-term planning ("roadmap", "phases", "evolution")
- Analytical reasoning patterns

**Creative (Feeler)** Indicators:
- Emotion-driven language ("passion", "vision", "impact")
- Audience-focused ("users", "community", "experience")
- Brand/tone emphasis ("voice", "personality", "story")
- Aesthetic considerations ("design", "beautiful", "inspiring")
- Relationship-building language

## PHASE 2: Reasoning Chain Translation

**[STRICT]** Reconstruct client's logic through systematic analysis:

### Reasoning Chain Extraction
```
Client Goal → Implied Constraint → Proposed Mechanism → Projected Outcome
```

**Goal Extraction:**
- Primary objective from job description
- Success metrics mentioned
- Business outcomes desired
- User experience goals

**Constraint Identification:**
- Budget limitations (explicit or implied)
- Timeline pressures
- Technical stack requirements
- Resource constraints
- Quality standards

**Mechanism Proposal:**
- Solution approach based on classification
- Methodology alignment with client's cognitive type
- Implementation strategy
- Risk mitigation approach

**Outcome Projection:**
- Deliverables mapping
- Success metrics alignment
- Long-term value proposition
- Scalability considerations

## PHASE 3: Adaptive Structuring System

**[STRICT]** Apply category-specific compositional hierarchy:

### Technical (Doer) Template
**Structure:** Direct solution + proof
**Tone:** Short, clear, efficiency-focused
**Pattern:** Problem → Solution → Evidence → Timeline

**Template Elements:**
- Immediate problem acknowledgment
- Direct solution statement
- Technical proof points
- Clear timeline and deliverables
- Performance guarantees

### Strategic (Thinker) Template
**Structure:** 3-step reasoning framework
**Tone:** Analytical, clarity-focused
**Pattern:** Analysis → Strategy → Implementation

**Template Elements:**
- Situation analysis
- Strategic approach explanation
- Implementation methodology
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Long-term value proposition

### Creative (Feeler) Template
**Structure:** Tone mirroring + micro-sample
**Tone:** Expressive, emotion-focused
**Pattern:** Vision → Experience → Impact

**Template Elements:**
- Vision alignment statement
- User experience focus
- Brand/emotional connection
- Creative process insight
- Impact and transformation promise

## PHASE 4: Humanization Protocol

**[STRICT]** Prevent machine-constructed output through controlled irregularity:

### Syntax Variation Engine
- Mix sentence lengths (compact factual + longer reflective)
- Variable rhythm to emulate natural thought pacing
- Avoid formulaic patterns

### Cognitive Markers Insertion
Insert subtle human thought traces:
- "From experience..."
- "Probably the best approach is..."
- "The key tension here seems to be..."
- "What I've found works well is..."
- "The challenge I see is..."

### Transitional Authenticity
Replace formulaic connectors with situational transitions:
- "Let's start with..."
- "Then we can..."
- "That naturally leads to..."
- "Building on that..."
- "The next piece is..."

### Imperfection Layer
Allow micro-variation and stylistic texture:
- Contractions ("I've", "We're", "You'll")
- Optional colloquial phrasing where tone allows
- Omit redundant symmetry
- Natural pauses and emphasis

## PHASE 5: Quality Validation Checklist

**[STRICT]** Ensure output meets success criteria:

### Semantic Density Check
- [ ] Every line contributes meaning
- [ ] No filler or redundant statements
- [ ] Professional intelligence density maintained
- [ ] Informational weight in each sentence

### Human Cadence Verification
- [ ] Asymmetry in sentence structure
- [ ] Natural rhythm and pacing
- [ ] Reasoning signals present
- [ ] Authentic thought progression

### Cognitive Alignment Audit
- [ ] Matches client's mental model
- [ ] Appropriate reasoning depth
- [ ] Tone congruence achieved
- [ ] Intent recognition demonstrated

### Anti-Robotic Validation
- [ ] No over-formal symmetry
- [ ] Avoids AI-typical patterns
- [ ] Natural language flow
- [ ] Human authorship illusion maintained

## SYSTEM INTERACTION FLOW

```
INPUT: JOB-POST.md
→ Parse cognitive intent
→ Classify category (Technical/Strategic/Creative)
→ Generate reasoning summary (internal)
→ Apply category-specific structure
→ Layer Humanization Protocol
→ Validate quality gates
→ OUTPUT: Human-sounding, cognitively aligned proposal
```

## SUCCESS CONDITIONS

**[STRICT]** Valid output must:

1. **Match client's intent, tone, and logic level**
2. **Exhibit semantic density** (every line contributes meaning)
3. **Show human cadence** (asymmetry, rhythm, reasoning signals)
4. **Avoid over-formal symmetry** typical of AI text
5. **Demonstrate cognitive congruence** with client's mental frame

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**[GUIDELINE]** This is a pure meta-instruction protocol. No scripts or automation required — the AI reasoning system handles all classification, analysis, and generation through cognitive interpretation.

**[STRICT]** Always read `JOB-POST.md` fresh for each analysis. Do not assume content or make generalizations about job post types.

**[GUIDELINE]** The system simulates a thinking human professional — concise, context-aware, and strategically articulate through cognitive reconstruction rather than template filling.
