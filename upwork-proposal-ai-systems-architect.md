## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Multi-Tenant Enterprise Platform Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AI Agent Orchestration Layer            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PM Agent → Dev Agent → QA Agent → Security Agent → Deploy │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                Multi-Tenant Core Platform                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tenant Management │ Data Isolation │ Security │ Payments  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Infrastructure & DevOps Layer                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Core Principles**:
- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data segregation with encrypted tenant boundaries
- **Shared Components**: Reusable microservices with tenant-specific configurations
- **Security-First**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive audit trails
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling infrastructure with load balancing and caching

### 2. AI Orchestration Framework Design

#### Agent Role Definitions
- **Project Manager Agent**: Task decomposition, dependency management, progress tracking
- **Architecture Agent**: System design, pattern enforcement, technical decision making
- **Development Agent**: Code generation, refactoring, feature implementation
- **QA Agent**: Test generation, code review, quality assurance
- **Security Agent**: Vulnerability scanning, compliance checking, security testing
- **DevOps Agent**: Infrastructure provisioning, deployment, monitoring setup

#### Communication Flows
```
PM Agent → Architecture Agent → Development Agent → QA Agent → Security Agent → DevOps Agent
    ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Task Queue → Design Review → Code Review → Test Suite → Security Scan → Deployment
```

#### Context Persistence & Memory
- **Shared Knowledge Base**: Centralized architectural decisions and patterns
- **Agent Memory**: Individual agent state persistence across sessions
- **Version Control**: Git-based code history with agent attribution
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of agent decisions and actions

### 3. Governance Model & Guardrails

#### Architectural Governance
- **Design Manifests**: Enforced architectural patterns and conventions
- **Code Standards**: Automated linting, formatting, and style enforcement
- **Tenancy Boundaries**: Strict enforcement of data isolation rules
- **API Contracts**: Automated validation of service interfaces

#### Quality Assurance Loops
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests generated by QA agents
- **Code Review**: Automated code analysis with human oversight points
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and alerting
- **Security Scanning**: Continuous vulnerability assessment and remediation

#### Failure Recovery Mechanisms
- **Prompt Drift Detection**: Monitoring and correction of agent behavior drift
- **Version Collision Prevention**: Automated conflict resolution in code merges
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Automated detection and resolution of dependency cycles
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Fact-checking and validation of architectural decisions
