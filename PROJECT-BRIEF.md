Summary
About the Platform (Confidential Startup Project)

We are building a global multi-category marketplace where users can:
• List & promote properties, rooms, or vehicles (sell / rent / share)
• Search & filter listings globally
• Register & log in with email/SMS authentication
• Subscribe to plans (Free / Plus / Pro) with ranking & contact limits
• Message & negotiate via built-in chat
• Pay via Stripe billing & upgrades

The platform will serve:
• Individual users (buyers, renters, sellers)
• Agencies & dealerships (real estate and automotive)
• Admin / operations team (moderation & system control)
