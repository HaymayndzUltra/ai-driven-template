# Project Brief: Global Real‑Time Payments and Risk Analytics Platform

## 1. Executive Summary
Build a globally distributed, multi-tenant FinTech platform for real‑time payments processing and risk analytics. It must ingest transactions at 50k TPS globally, perform sub‑50ms risk scoring, execute instant payments, and satisfy strict financial compliance across multiple jurisdictions. Core capabilities include fraud detection with online ML inference, dynamic 3‑D Secure flows, dispute management, ledgering, reconciliation, and comprehensive audit evidence. The system must be zero‑downtime deployable and deliver provable controls for PCI‑DSS and SOX.

## 2. Objectives
- Real‑time authorization, clearing, and settlement with strong consistency for ledger operations.
- Online fraud/risk scoring with feature store, drift detection, and human‑in‑the‑loop reviews.
- Global routing and regulated data residency with regional shards and cross‑region replay.
- Developer experience that enables safe, automated changes with guardrails and evidence capture.

## 3. Scope
- In-scope: Payment APIs (cards, A2A, wallets), risk engine, ledger, reconciliation, merchant dashboard, multi‑region infra, observability, compliance automation, ML online/offline pipelines.
- Out-of-scope: Card issuing, BNPL underwriting, core banking.

## 4. Personas
- Merchant Admins, Finance/Ops, Risk Analysts, Support Agents, Platform SREs, Data Scientists.

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Payments:
  - Card authorization/capture, refunds, partial/refund, chargebacks; PSD2 SCA/3DS flows; idempotency keys.
  - A2A (Open Banking/PSD2) initiation; webhooks with signed payloads and retries.
- Risk:
  - Online inference API (<50ms p95) using precomputed + streaming features; adaptive rules; case management UI.
- Ledger & Reconciliation:
  - Double‑entry ledger; exact‑once semantics; daily automated reconciliation vs processor statements.
- Dashboard:
  - Multi‑tenant RBAC; real‑time dashboards; dispute workflows; audit trails for every action.
- Integrations:
  - PSP connectors (Stripe-like, Adyen-like), open banking aggregators, KYC/KYB providers.
- Data Residency:
  - EU data stays in EU; PII tokenization with format‑preserving encryption; cross‑region metadata replication only.

## 6. Non‑Functional Requirements
- Performance: 50k TPS ingest; p95 auth 150ms; p99 risk 80ms; Web UI LCP < 2.5s.
- Reliability: Core payment path 99.99%; zero‑downtime deploys (blue/green or canary); backpressure with shed.
- Consistency: Strong consistency for ledger; causal consistency for analytics; idempotent APIs.
- Security: mTLS, OIDC, short‑lived credentials, Vault‑backed secrets, HSM for PAN tokens.
- Cost: Autoscaling policies; storage tiering; Kafka topic compaction and retention hygiene.

## 7. High‑Level Architecture
- Edge/API Gateways (Envoy/Istio ingress) → API services (Go/Kotlin) → Kafka (MSK) → Risk Engine (Python/Go) → Ledger (Postgres + CQRS) → Reconciliation (ClickHouse analytics; batch + streaming).
- ML Platform: Feature Store (Feast on Redis/ClickHouse), Model Registry (MLflow), CI for models, canary rollouts with shadow traffic and A/B.
- Data Platform: OLTP (Postgres), wide‑column (Cassandra) for session/ids, ClickHouse for analytics, Debezium CDC from OLTP to Kafka to OLAP.

## 8. Data Model Overview
- Entities: Merchant, Account, PaymentIntent, Charge, Refund, Dispute, LedgerEntry, Payout, Case, FeatureVector, ModelVersion, Policy.
- PII handling: Tokenize PAN; store token + last4; FPE for necessary masked presentation; encryption keys in KMS/HSM.

## 9. API Surface (Representative)
- REST/gRPC:
  - POST /v1/payment_intents
  - POST /v1/charges
  - POST /v1/refunds
  - POST /v1/chargebacks
  - POST /v1/risk/score
  - GET /v1/ledger/entries?account_id=…
  - POST /v1/webhooks/endpoints
- Webhooks:
  - payment.succeeded, payment.failed, refund.created, dispute.opened, payout.paid

## 10. Risk/ML Requirements
- Online inference: PyTorch models compiled to TorchScript/ONNX; warmed instances; cold start < 200ms.
- Feature Store: streaming (Kafka) + batch materialization; TTL controls; P99 get < 5ms.
- Monitoring: drift detection (PSI/KL divergence), model performance dashboards, auto‑rollback on SLA breach.
- Governance: versioned models with approvals; lineage; reproducibility; signed model artifacts.

## 11. Security & Compliance
- PCI‑DSS scope isolation: card data isolated micro‑segment; PAN tokenization via CloudHSM; restricted access via SPIFFE/SPIRE identities.
- SOX controls: change approvals, segregation of duties, evidence artifacts for releases.
- GDPR: DSRs (access/erasure/export); residency and data minimization; lawful basis tagging.
- Continuous controls: CodeQL SAST, Trivy image scans, dependency audits, signed images, SBOMs.

## 12. Observability
- OpenTelemetry everywhere; exemplars to ClickHouse/Tempo; SLOs with burn rate alerts.
- Audit trail: immutable logs (WORM in S3); chain‑of‑custody for financial events.

## 13. CI/CD
- Pipelines:
  - Build: cache‑optimized; SBOM + attestation
  - Test: unit/integration/contract/e2e/perf/security
  - Release: canary → 5%/25%/100% with auto‑abort on error budgets
- Environments use GitOps (ArgoCD) with per‑env Kustomize overlays.

## 14. Environments & Release
- Dev: frequent merges; feature flags
- Staging/UAT: prod‑like data via synthetic generation; perf env with target loads
- Prod: multi‑region active‑active for stateless; active‑passive for stateful with cross‑region async replication

## 15. Risk Register (Top)
- Payment rail outages → circuit breakers + alternate routes
- Model drift → shadow deploys + automated rollback
- Kafka contention → partition strategy + quota enforcement
- Key compromise → short TTLs + automated rotation + kill‑switch

## 16. Milestones (Indicative)
- M1 (4w): Core scaffolding, CI/CD, baseline protocols, sample PSP connector
- M2 (8w): Risk v1, ledger MVP, dashboard alpha
- M3 (12w): Multi‑region infra, reconciliation, observability v1
- M4 (16w): Compliance baseline (PCI‑DSS readiness), perf goals met, pilot merchants
- GA (20w): Full SLAs/SLOs, chargeback workflows, audited release

## 17. Acceptance Criteria
- Throughput: ≥ 50k TPS ingest; risk p95 < 50ms; auth p95 < 150ms
- Availability: core 99.99%; zero‑downtime deploys demonstrated
- Compliance: PCI‑DSS ROC pre‑assessment passed; SOC2 controls mapped with evidence
- Observability: SLOs/alerts defined; dashboards for key flows; complete audit trails
- Data residency: verified via automated policy checks and region‑scoped storage
- ML: canary deployment with shadow traffic; automated rollback on KPI regressions

## 18. Deliverables
- Source code (services, infra IaC, dashboards)
- API specs (OpenAPI + protobufs)
- Runbooks and playbooks
- Compliance evidence pack (automated)
- Model registry entries and docs
- Performance test reports and tuning guides

## 19. Execution Protocols (Explicit)
- Execute in order:
  - 0-bootstrap
  - 1-prd-creation
  - 2-task-generation
  - 3-implementation
  - 4-quality-audit
  - 5-retrospective
  - 6-operations
  - ml-experiments

## 20. Notes for Orchestrator
- Ensure 6-operations is included (multi‑region rollout, failover tests).
- Include ml-experiments (online inference, feature store, drift detection).
- Enforce quality gates at each phase; collect evidence artifacts.
