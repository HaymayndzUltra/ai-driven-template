## Domain-Specific Validation

### [ ] **Technical Workflows**
- [ ] Technical constraints are properly defined
- [ ] Implementation patterns are specified
- [ ] Technology stack considerations are included
- [ ] Performance requirements are addressed
- [ ] Security considerations are covered

### [ ] **Business Workflows**

### [ ] **Process Workflows**
- [ ] Process steps are clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies are properly mapped
- [ ] Handoff points are identified
- [ ] Process metrics are established
- [ ] Continuous improvement is enabled

## Testing and Validation

### [ ] **Template Testing**
- [ ] Template has been applied to at least 2 different domains
- [ ] Cognitive phases work across different contexts
- [ ] Decision matrices are adaptable
- [ ] Automation hooks are functional
- [ ] Human interaction patterns are consistent

### [ ] **Quality Metrics**
- [ ] Template completeness score ≥ 90%
- [ ] Human validation points ≥ 3 per workflow
- [ ] Automation integration points ≥ 2 per workflow
- [ ] Evidence capture points ≥ 1 per phase
- [ ] Deliverable template completeness ≥ 95%

### [ ] **User Experience**
- [ ] Template is easy to understand and apply
- [ ] Cognitive phases feel natural to follow
- [ ] Human validation points are appropriately placed
- [ ] Automation integration is seamless
- [ ] Deliverable templates are actionable

## Common Issues and Solutions

### [ ] **Role Ambiguity**
- **Issue:** AI role is unclear or too broad
- **Solution:** Define specific persona with clear boundaries
- **Check:** Can another AI understand the role without context?

### [ ] **Missing Prerequisites**
- **Issue:** AI proceeds without proper context
- **Solution:** Add mandatory context gathering steps
- **Check:** Does AI load necessary knowledge before acting?

### [ ] **Weak Validation Gates**
- **Issue:** Human validation is insufficient
- **Solution:** Add more validation checkpoints
- **Check:** Are key decisions validated by humans?

### [ ] **Automation Gaps**
- **Issue:** Automation scripts are not properly integrated
- **Solution:** Bind scripts to specific reasoning checkpoints
- **Check:** Do automation scripts serve reasoning phases?

### [ ] **Template Incompleteness**
- **Issue:** Deliverable template is too generic
- **Solution:** Add domain-specific sections and fields
- **Check:** Can implementation proceed directly from template?

## Success Criteria
