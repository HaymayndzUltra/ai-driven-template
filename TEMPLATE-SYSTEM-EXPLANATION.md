## Component Integration Explained

### 1. AGENTS.md (AI Agent Configuration)

**Purpose**: Configures the AI agent behavior per Codex 2025 standards

**What it contains**:
- Agent capabilities and limitations
- Coding style preferences
- Architecture decision guidelines
- Protocol selection logic
- Evidence collection standards
- Integration points with other components

**How it works**:
- AI reads AGENTS.md when @protocol-orchestrator is invoked
- Provides compressed knowledge not visible in codebase
- Guides AI behavior during protocol orchestration
- Sets preferences for code generation and quality standards

**Example integration**:
```
When AI analyzes PROJECT-BRIEF.md:
1. Reads AGENTS.md to understand capabilities
2. Applies coding preferences from AGENTS.md
3. Uses protocol selection logic from AGENTS.md
4. Follows evidence collection standards from AGENTS.md
```

### 2. .mdc Rules (Modern Context Discovery)

**Purpose**: Provides contextual rules for AI behavior (replaces deprecated .cursorrules)

**Structure**:
```yaml
---
description: "TAGS: [global,workflow] | TRIGGERS: protocol,orchestrator | SCOPE: global | DESCRIPTION: Protocol orchestration rules"
alwaysApply: true
---
# Rule content in Markdown
```

**How it works**:
- AI discovers relevant rules based on TAGS, TRIGGERS, SCOPE
- Rules provide context-specific guidance
- Master-rules (8) provide global governance
- Common-rules (10) provide shared patterns
- Project-rules provide project-specific customizations

**Integration with AGENTS.md**:
- AGENTS.md specifies which rules to load
- Rules provide detailed context for AI decisions
- Together they create comprehensive AI behavior configuration

### 3. .cursor/commands/ (Slash Commands)

**Purpose**: Provides quick access to complex AI workflows

**How it works**:
- User types `/protocol-orchestrator` to invoke workflow
- Cursor loads the command file with AI instructions
- AI executes the workflow defined in the command
- Commands can generate other commands dynamically

**Integration**:
- @protocol-orchestrator.md triggers the main workflow
- Generated protocols become numbered commands (00-, 01-, 02-)
- Each command contains AI execution instructions
- Commands reference AGENTS.md and .mdc rules

### 4. Protocol Orchestrator System

**Purpose**: Intelligent analysis and protocol generation

**Input**: PROJECT-BRIEF.md
**Output**: Sequentially-numbered command files

**Process**:
1. **Analysis**: Parse brief, extract metadata, classify project
2. **Planning**: Select protocols, resolve dependencies, create sequence
3. **Generation**: Create command files with project-specific parameters
4. **Validation**: Ensure completeness and integration

**Integration with other components**:
- Reads AGENTS.md for agent configuration
- Loads .mdc rules for context
- Generates .cursor/commands/ files
- Binds automation scripts to protocols
- Sets up evidence collection

System Process:
1. AI reads AGENTS.md (agent configuration)
2. AI loads relevant .mdc rules (context)
3. AI analyzes PROJECT-BRIEF.md
4. AI classifies project (type, stack, complexity, lifecycle)
5. AI selects appropriate protocols
6. AI generates numbered command files (00-, 01-, 02-)
7. AI presents generated sequence for approval
```

### Phase 3: Execution
```
User Action: Executes generated protocols sequentially
System Process:
1. AI loads protocol command file
2. AI applies relevant .mdc rules
3. AI executes protocol steps automatically
4. AI runs validation scripts
5. AI collects evidence artifacts
6. AI reports completion status
```

### Phase 4: Quality Gates
```
System Process:
1. AI runs test suites automatically
2. AI checks code coverage
3. AI performs security scanning
4. AI validates quality thresholds
5. AI collects evidence for retrospective
```

### Phase 5: Learning
```
System Process:
1. AI analyzes evidence artifacts
2. AI generates retrospective report
3. AI identifies improvement opportunities
4. AI updates knowledge base
5. AI suggests system improvements
```

```

**AI Orchestration**:
1. Reads AGENTS.md → Understands capabilities
2. Loads .mdc rules → Gets context for web projects
3. Analyzes brief → Classifies as "web-app, frontend-only, simple, MVP"
4. Selects protocols → Skips backend, focuses on UI/UX
5. Generates commands:
   - `00-analyze-brief.md`
   - `01-design-ui-components.md`
   - `02-implement-frontend.md`
   - `03-validate-accessibility.md`
   - `04-deployment-guide.md`

**Execution**:
